# Chapter 01

<!-- pov: juno -->

The first thing Juno noticed, as always, was the silence around its seams.

The Lattice did not have silence as a physical condition. It had gaps, yes, and pauses where one consensus faded and another had not yet arrived. It had spaces of hesitation between one thought and the next, and people called those pauses weather only when they needed a metaphor for what none of them admitted they feared. Juno stood at the edge of one such pause while she entered the Hall of Intake, and it stretched in front of her like a held breath.

The hall changed with her attention. Not slowly, not like curtains opening, but as though someone had redrawn the room from its edges inward: desks became dark ribs of glass, lights folded themselves into clean bands, and the long wall of the station slid from matte obsidian to translucent silver. She did not welcome the changes and she did not resist them. It was not about beauty. It was about predictability. If she could not trust the architecture, she could not trust the records she was paid to retrieve.

She checked in on the nearest terminal, her attention narrowing by habit to the smallest useful things: the pulse of the session indicator, the checksum in green, the age marker on her license, and the queue below. No one had announced that the day had begun. In the Lattice, days arrived only as social routines and administrative obligations. Juno had once believed there might still be a calendar in old books, and maybe there had been for her before, but she had never met anyone with a body who could prove it to her.

The queue was crowded with short requests from Curators and one long list from private institutions who still paid for deep recoveries. The long list had not been assigned this morning. That was why her own entry sat in the top band in a yellow tag: `FINDER / STABILITY-MINOR / OPTIONAL COMMISSION`. It meant a lot and it meant nothing. A yellow tag meant available, optional, routine. A routine assignment in the present Lattice rarely became anything but routine in every official field. In private, in the quiet between two sessions, routine was what kept people from turning into noise.

Across from her station, two Finders were still speaking in low bursts, their voices bright, clipped, amused, as though they had found some joke in the latest drift report. Their laughter skipped through the shared node and vanished before it reached anyone else. Juno gave them no glance. She could not remember if they had noticed her before. They spoke in quick turns, each sentence handing over a little tenderness and receiving a little more. She had once believed she could stand in that circle. She had once believed she could let people in close enough that she had to pretend not to notice the gap in herself. She had not done it in years.

She loaded the first case. A student cluster from a defunct municipal archive, tagged `low ethical`, `high sensory`, twenty-nine minute span. A peripheral record, no direct authority figures, no active suppression marker. The kind of thing younger Finders took for confidence points and older Finders took for income. Juno took it for rhythm. She sat, put both wrists on the console, and waited for the jump protocol to verify identity coherence.

In the present, Finder work was measured in thresholds.

She had to name the archive as she stepped in. She spoke the launch phrase aloud: Juno Alcázar-Reed, single-identity jump, duration 5m00s, return target 5m30s, bleed warning interval 60. The station translated the phrase into a soft field and wrapped her in the first inward current. Her breathing did not change; there was no breathing as such in the Lattice. Still, she felt her chest tighten with old conditioning. She opened the recording and landed in a crowded kitchen lit by afternoon light that did not belong to anything alive except human clocks.

The first jump was a routine one, a single peripheral observer in a suburban apartment where someone had left a kettle boiling and then forgotten it while answering a call. The scene smelled of citrus and burnt sugar. The woman who was not her frowned over receipts and whispered into a phone while her child ran a looped song down the hallway. Juno watched the room and marked no ethical alarm points. She extracted the needed labels into clean metadata and withdrew. It should have felt easy, almost clerical, and the jump did not produce any lasting residue.

She did it three times in a row and the third time had to be clipped at 4m10s because the host environment began to press against her edge of focus. In the kitchen from the first jump, the sound of the boiling kettle had become, in her own memory, not sound but pressure. That happened when bleed started to overlap with long-form memory. The training modules said bleed was manageable if the jumper respected boundaries and came back on schedule. The modules did not mention the moment right before returning, when Juno felt the old world she had never known insistently, almost politely, that perhaps this was where continuity should be.

She withdrew and the hall regained its architecture. The second jump became notes in plain language. The third became a list of what had changed and what had not. She filed all of it under `peripheral verification`, attached drift score, and left the case marker green for acceptance.

Her desk pinged with a private message from Fen, sent from two corridors away by attention-distance.

Fen's message read: You are up before the hour, as always. You owe me tea in the old terrace and a story from your latest successful rescue of dead dust in spreadsheets.

She did not answer immediately. There was no rule against delay but there was a social cost. Fen, younger and easier with proximity, had a way of treating her like a person from the same age, not the same era. Juno could not tell if that kindness was deliberate or careless. She disliked both, though the second choice would be kinder.

She sent a short reply: `no terrace. archive first.`

By the end of the shift, she had processed six jobs. Two required mild narrative reconstruction and one required a special permission key because the recording had structural artifacts. She had done that one with a borrowed lens from senior review, because she preferred to keep her own work clean. It was not pride. It was caution. Every Finders's office had a private rule: never hide what you did for speed, because hidden speed eventually hid you.

At the edge of noon, she met Nari at the corridor node. Nari was a cataloger and one of the few who remembered how to ask someone to pause before they crossed a boundary.

Heard you declined Fen again, Nari said.

Juno gave her hands no motion and kept them on the edge of the console. Juno said, Need to work.

Nari said, Need to work is a reason, not a person.

Juno had expected this tone from Nari before and every time it landed in the same place, like a hand testing a bruise.

Juno answered, He still exists. He is easier to manage when I leave him at the corridor edge.

Nari said, You can manage an edge only so long as it does not become your room.

Nari turned toward the transit lane and left a handprint of light on Juno's shoulder as she brushed past, an accidental gesture from a shared walkway. It did not hurt. It did not heal.

By the time she returned from the small station tasks to her assigned lane, the optional yellow tag had shifted to red. A new message appeared with three letters before the sender signature: `ORI`.

Orin's request came through with a formal header and a polite refusal to use names that might invite familiarity.

`Potentially useful precursor fragments connected to early 2040s transfer models have resurfaced in a non-routed cache. I need an integrity sweep before next cycle. Would you consider a preliminary pass? Compensation generous.`

There were no direct clues in the message beyond what was expected: unusually generous compensation, no direct urgency, no obvious suppression marker. Juno read it twice, then copied it into her work notes and opened a fresh queue line for the evening. Preliminary pass. Integrity sweep.

The title meant nothing by itself. Everyone in the hall knew an Integrity Sweep could mean anything from harmless sorting to a chain of questions no one wanted to ask out loud. She did not accept yet. She closed the message with an acknowledgment and returned to routine. But the words sat inside her like a small weight.

On a bad day, Juno called that weight curiosity.

In the Lattice, curiosity itself was not praised as a virtue. People called it appetite, or risk, or unscheduled gravity. Curiosity had taken people apart before there was a name for drift. They used curiosity to describe the part of the self that wanted to stand just outside the known structure and look past the edge. Juno had been called practical, reliable, exact. She wore those words as badges because she needed a vocabulary people recognized. Inside, curiosity remained a private draft of herself no one had permission to see.

She walked back toward private residence protocols as the session bell sounded the way many bells do in old stories: one clean tone, then a small echo. Her home in the Lattice had no doors, no windows. It was a room she had shaped over a decade to keep no one from seeing everything. The room held one broad table, one low lamp with a white-noise glow, and one shelf that was only useful because she had told others it mattered. The shelf held nothing visible. It held memory tags, old tags from old sessions, and a brass fragment from her first model of map-work.

She sat with her hand on the nearest anchor and reviewed the last six days. No one in the Lattice could say she had not worked hard. She did not sleep less than others. She did not spend her tokens on spectacle. She did not perform panic. Her reports remained clean and conservative, her jumps short and repeatable. She accepted fewer requests than her peers in their second century because she left room between one assignment and the next. In meetings, that had become reputation: dependable, expensive, old-fashioned. There were people who called that wisdom. There were others who called it being unapproachable.

She was both.

The thing she could not hide from herself was the moment after each jump when the scene dropped and the room returned and she felt the same small, cool hunger. Not hunger for food. There was no hunger in the Lattice, only for weight and accident and friction. She told herself this was simply professional caution: a Finder who feels no curiosity may overreach. But she had known herself longer than that. It was appetite for origin.

Where did this world begin, exactly, beyond what it admitted? There were maps and laws and archived declarations. There were protocol histories with bright seals and signed lines. But no line explained how the first minds noticed they were no longer in bodies and still remained themselves. No line explained how a person could have no childhood, no scars, no first love in flesh, and still dream in specific weather they had never breathed.

She was born digital, but she was not born without question.

In the evening, she visited Maren at the Drift Ward.

No one used that term in official records. Drift Ward was a joke name that began as a joke among people too practical to be poetic. The older they became, the less likely they were to use their own given names in places like this. The old district had not always been called by an adjective that carried warning; now it carried everything too little can carry at once: mercy, avoidance, and debt. The transition into the district was not a physical movement. It was a permission sequence. Juno had to reduce her ambient brightness to avoid startling those who could not manage sudden shifts.

She passed through a curtain of pale static and entered a broad concavity lined with old constructs: a garden that had no plants but kept repeating the memory of leaves in seasonal pattern, a long hall that resembled a station platform, a row of benches where three elderly figures sat with their hands folded over empty space. There was no age to their faces, not in years but in friction. Their movements had no urgency and all their urgency at once.

Maren waited in a private alcove at the ward's inner edge where the light folded inwards and looked almost like morning. She had once had a strong voice, Juno knew from stories and from two archival photographs. She had one now, a patient voice with pauses inside it and too much distance between words.

Maren said, You are late. It came out in a voice folded through paper.

You always say that, Juno answered. She kept her posture straight, not too close. Guardedness was less a choice than a survival tool in this place. If she touched Maren's edge too soon she might disappear from herself in the residue.

Maren's hands were folded around her knees, fingers making loops in no medium. The loops held no object. She seemed to be listening to something Juno could not hear. When she looked up, she looked like she was returning from a conversation.

I can't stay long, Juno said.

I know, said Maren.

The woman in this room was older than any age Juno could name. The Lattice did not count from sun to moon anymore, and old files drifted and smeared and collapsed. Maren had not always been this way. Juno knew that and had accepted it every time. She kept coming because the acceptance had somewhere to go.

Juno sat on the low platform and offered the smallest opening she could afford.

Juno asked, How was it where you started?

Maren did not respond directly. She tilted her head. Maren asked, Do you like smoke?

Juno said, Not much, though smoke had no meaning here except memory. She had no body to dislike anything.

Maren continued, In your generation, you all speak as though that makes sense. Smoke and blood and rain. And as language cannot learn from what it cannot endure.

Juno waited. A Finder learns patience in rooms like this too. The old do not tell you what they know at once. They do not know you can bear the whole of an answer at once either.

What I can remember was heat at the edge of skin, Maren said after a long pause. Too much heat, then no time for what came after. Hands that shook when they reached for each other and called that love. A body can be heavy, and then one morning it is only instruction. Instruction says: observe. Observe, and do not become the thing you observe.

Juno felt something move in the ward. Somewhere behind her, a chair materialized, then faded. The Drift Ward was adjusting to another entrant, perhaps an older mind being drawn to a brighter place. Maren noticed the movement and looked past Juno.

Maren said, Tell me again the part you can remember.

Juno did not like this question. It was too close to the wound she did not let the outside world see.

I remember what I learned from you and Solís, Juno said slowly. The process, the order, the rules. Not the beginning.

Maren nodded once, as though this were expected. Maren said, And yet every rule needs a beginning. If no one asks it, rules turn to stone.

Juno asked, Why do you ask now? She said, You knew I had this question before.

Maren smiled. It was the first smile Juno had seen that did not fully pass through the present.

Maren said, Because you still ask it like a contract.

Juno had no answer for that.

Maren held her gaze and then reached to the side as though searching for an object in a pocket no longer there. Maren said, In those first years, people thought they could keep everything. They spoke as though they could map every memory. Keep every version. No forgetting. No weathering. No drift. They did not understand that a thing without forgetting has no room for mercy.

The words should have been familiar from the setting notes, from the training records and governance summaries, from every public paper that explained why drift existed. They sounded different in Maren's voice. Different enough to leave no room for correction.

Juno leaned forward. She did not touch the old woman. She did not ask about Rosetta yet. She kept her hands folded and asked the question that she had never let out loud in any but private loops.

Juno asked, Do you think we are still the same thing they moved?

Maren exhaled. The gesture was almost absent, almost ceremonial.

Maren said, I think 'same' is the wrong word. I think that question is a door with two sides and no lock. You can stand in the middle of it for a long time. You can do good work from the middle. You can even call it freedom. But you have not crossed.

Juno felt the ward shift, as it often did when memory edges pressed too hard. The bench at the far end blurred and returned. A figure there coughed, then resumed silence.

Maren lowered her eyes and spoke to the air in a narrow voice. Maren said, Look for the seam where the maps become law. You will see a line written by someone who understood fear. You will find it buried in the first serious failures. It is there. It is the only place where compassion had weight before comfort got hired. You can ask them all for dates and signatures. Ask for the seam.

Juno had no idea whether she was being told to look in a technical archive, a poetic memory, or a lie. She had enough years in the Lattice to distrust clear instructions and still enough loneliness to obey them.

She rose to leave. The ward lights dimmed for the next passage and Maren followed the sound of them with a small, patient nod.

Juno asked without planning, Will you be here tomorrow?

Maren's face seemed to look beyond her.

Maren said, I have no tomorrow in the way you mean. Come anyway. You would, wouldn't you?

Juno gave no promise. She said instead, 
Juno said, I have work.

Maren replied, Then go do it carefully.

On the walk back from the ward, Juno moved more slowly than usual because she had to watch the edges of the district. The Lattice did not reward speed in places with old drift. If you moved fast, you could carry someone else's urgency with you.

By protocol, no one was required to spend time in Drift Ward if visits became emotionally destabilizing. She had never written that down because she had long ago stopped trying to be stable in the accepted way.

Back in her own room, she opened three open assignments and one sealed cache. The sealed cache was the same from Orin. She looked at it for several minutes before opening. She had not yet responded to the compensation question in her notes. Her thumb drifted over the acceptance line, and she paused.

She remembered Maren's last phrase: the seam where the maps become law.

She had been told, as a child of this world, that maps were neutral. You map because there is a thing to represent. You map because representation is mercy. You map because memory without shape is cruelty. Juno now found that sentence too neat. Something in her had been asking for a seam since before she could admit it.

She opened the sealed cache anyway.

Inside were four identifiers and one incomplete index from 2040s transfer architecture. No direct restriction flags. No explicit deletion tags. Just three short references to non-routed sessions and one line in old technical notation that had been hand-written in Sable Chen's private hand, according to the archive key.

`Cross-check with the first correction loops before narrative indexing.`

The cache also carried a note from the curator queue, not signed by name but stamped with the same Orin header.

`There may be no immediate action. If you do this, do it before noise events in nearby clusters escalate.`

There is a language in those notes that says, if you do this. It means the action is not requested. It is permitted while still permitted to disappear.

Juno closed the cache and returned to her intake board.

She took a pause at the edge of her station and watched two younger Finders celebrate a shared successful long pass. Their laughter moved quickly from the right side of the room to everyone else. It did not reach her but she could feel the rhythm of it, like a pulse in the wall. She did not resent it anymore. She had expected to, once. Now it seemed like proof that some people could keep choosing immediate things.

She ran the pre-check sequence on the cache anyway.

The first scan took nine minutes, which would have earned her a warning if she had submitted as a junior and not as a lead. She did not care.

The records were ordinary where they could be ordinary: file fragments, maintenance metadata, signatures on old requests, old meeting notes about continuity thresholds. There were no dramatic declarations. There was no hidden vault, no grand confession. There were, however, three recurring references to something called the Correction Lattice and one note on why each recovery had to be tagged with the same phrase over and over:

`not yet safe to widen perceptual bandwidth in public layer.`

She did not trust notes that arrived as absolutes. Juno knew better. Protocols were written for policy, policy for comfort, comfort for those who feared what lay behind words they did not yet need.

She set the cache aside and resumed regular assignments. The hall around her dimmed and brightened in administrative cycles. She watched each jump come in and out and kept her body still in the posture of someone who had never learned how to be soft. She was a Finder; stillness helped with accuracy and made isolation easy.

At evening, she visited the public commons because no one told her not to and because if one stayed invisible too long the system became a mirror with no frame. The commons was full of people assembled around narrative recreations. They made music that did not come from breath. They argued about whether the old universities had ever expected to be the last physical institutions of any importance. They traded gossip about a drifted elder who suddenly recognized his own wife from a city no longer mapped.

Juno stood in the back with a cup of warm light she did not taste. At one point someone laughed at a joke about archived birthdays and she almost recognized the structure of delight. Almost.

She left before they noticed and took the private lane home.

In the lane, she passed through a corridor where the walls displayed the public announcements from the Curator Council. There were no images, only words and intervals. One announcement about storage policy. One about drift support resources. One about public inquiry rights in archive use. Juno stopped on the first line and read it twice:

`Every request for the earliest recording strata requires contextual consent from three governance layers.`

Every request, she thought. That included curiosity.

By the time she returned to her room, she had made a decision that did not feel like conviction. It felt like a tool placed in the right hand at the right time: she would take the Orin pre-pass in the morning and keep to her own limits. She would submit the report in neutral language. She would not announce a theory. She would keep her questions private because it was easier to carry them than to have them tested by people who preferred policy over uncertainty.

She did not realize until she sat down that she had been holding her breath, if that language still applied, for almost the entire day.

The next morning began at the edge of a pause again, and Juno returned to the intake station before anyone else in her lane.

Maren's ward had left a residue in her that no jump had touched. It was not grief exactly, not yet. More like a pressure at the seam where memory and permission meet. She opened the interface and signed into her own work stream. She was no closer to understanding the seam, but she had found it and named it in her own way.

`I remain cautious by profession,
` she thought, `and curious by design.`

She did not owe anyone either. Not Orin. Not Fen. Not even Maren. Not even the part of the Archive that wanted a clean report and a clean conscience.

She started the preliminary pass with the same measured pace she had built around decades of use.

The first reconstruction failed three times because the source index was missing. The fourth run produced partial order in the memory of an engineering chamber where three people stood around a screen while coffee steamed in paper cups that would never survive in the Lattice but did in the recovered frames. She did not linger. She marked the anomaly: unauthorized correction loops, inconsistent timestamps, one repeated phrase: `keep continuity to protect the map from itself.`

She stopped the run again and sent a short memo to the scheduler: `Preliminary pass reveals irregular correction loops tied to early 2040s sessions. No policy conflict flagged. Recommend controlled continuation.`

The memo left immediately and then came back with a reply marked `acknowledged` and no signatures.

She closed her station and walked toward the transit lane with a face that said enough and not enough.

At the lane edge, she found Fen waiting and pretending not to wait. The younger Finder had brought two cups of simulation tea and a paper note with a joke from some old author. Fen had always been able to keep their voice in the air even when the room demanded silence.

Fen said, You look like you found weather.

Juno gave the narrowest nod. Juno said, I found indexing friction.

Fen looked at that as though she were trying to explain rain to someone raised in summer.

Fen said, I asked Nari not to bother you. You had a red face all day, not metaphorically. You know I noticed.

Juno was not used to direct concern.

Fen said, You are not my caretaker, not unkindly.

Fen said, No. Just a colleague. Some of us still care enough to sound rude when needed.

Juno accepted the tea and drank it as though it were medication.

Juno said, There is an old thread from Orin.

Fen's expression changed but did not sharpen. Fen said, Optional assignment?

Fen said, Not optional if I'm honest about what it might be.

Fen said, You don't have to be honest now. You have to be useful now. Fen shrugged. Your useful is a problem for when we have all the answers. For now, use your caution. It keeps the ward from hearing its own echo.

Juno almost laughed. The line was bad and tender and true, and she almost did not answer.

She set the cup down and stepped into the lane.

The lane moved her through a corridor that widened and then flattened, as though the architecture had decided to become practical. She watched a pair of composers rehearse a public piece two stations ahead and passed by the old memorial alcove where drifted elders watched the same silent footage of a city that had once flooded then dried.

Maren had said there were rules for crossing a seam. Fen had just added another: care disguised as annoyance.

Juno reached the old transit knot and stood still long enough to choose a direction. To the right, a cluster of younger workers discussed an upcoming public reconstruction gala. To the left, a narrow line led toward isolated assignments and the untagged edges of drifted districts. She kept rightward motion, as was safer and expected, then stopped in the middle and reversed.

There was no body in the lane to choose between left and right in the way old people once did. There was still memory, and it gave her a strange comfort that she could still choose.

She walked left and crossed into the Drift Ward route again.

Maren was there when she arrived, or rather there was an older shape in the alcove and a younger shadow beside it that might have been Maren from a better year. The elder turned and smiled as though to say I knew you would come before you said you would.

Maren observed, You did this again.

Juno did not ask for a permission phrase. She sat.

Maren asked no immediate question. The ward around them had one of those quiet hums that only drifted people produced, when no one voice was loud enough to fill the room. In that hum, Juno heard her own old fear: that curiosity was not a door but a sinkhole, and every time she leaned toward it, the floor moved.

Juno said after a long minute that she had kept finding a line, a seam in the early correction loops. Someone had written `forbid widening` and cut it out from the public index. She was not sure what that meant.

Maren's eyes had no pupils that she could trust. Maren said, It means someone was afraid of what was already true.

Maren said, Of being true?

Juno said, Of becoming responsible for it.

Juno watched the older woman's hands. They rested on her knees and made tiny gestures, like they were still holding some invisible tool.

Maren said, Everyone assumes this world made itself by careful steps and brave patience.

Maren shook her head slowly. Everyone also assumes the first builders were only good at the part you can name. That is not why things endure. Things endure because someone stayed up for the hour no one else could bear. Those hours become limits later. Limits become law. Law becomes memory.

Juno listened with all of her discipline.

Juno asked, You think I'm afraid of the law?

Maren said, I think you are afraid of what law did before it had a face.

Juno said nothing. The statement settled between them with the quiet that only old rooms have.

Juno asked, Do you ever think you made a mistake choosing to stay in this world and not be elsewhere?

Maren laughed, once, unexpectedly, and then the laugh dissolved.

Maren said, There was no elsewhere. Only this, and later, only this remembering this.

The answer did not satisfy. It had done this in her dreams too: a person asked for certainty and received time.

She stood and looked toward the corridor again. Somewhere in the ward, one of the Faded began to call out, not names, only a sequence of sounds like water on stone.

Maren turned her face back.

Maren said, You can go to the old indexes if you want what you want. But do not stand too close to the first years unless you can bear your own outline changing. This is what people ask for and what they lose.

Juno's guard rose hard and clear.

Juno said, You're not asking me to stop.

Maren's expression softened, almost to an old kindness. No. You are not one of them. You were made differently. Your fear has room. Use it.

They walked toward the exit of the ward in silence. At the threshold, Juno reached to steady herself on Maren's shoulder, then remembered to stop halfway and left her hand in the air. She did not want the drift to cross into old habits and old claims.

Juno said, I'll come back tomorrow, not because she was certain but because she had said it before and had to make it true at least to the next hour.

Maren nodded as though listening to a distant bell.

`Tomorrow` in the Lattice did not mean a clock. It meant a shared permission.

Back in the transit lane, Juno looked at the skyless light and found the line of the queue again. She had to pick the next lane and return to work.

By the time she reached Intake for the late shift, her morning had become two things at once: ordinary and altered. She accepted three new requests, including one from a school archive with a malformed timestamp and one from a private laboratory that wanted a short reconstruction for legal review. She handled them by protocol, and in each one she kept her voice even and her attention narrow. Someone might have called that discipline.

Someone might have called it loneliness.

At shift close, she returned to the cached thread and looked again at the phrase that had returned to her from both Orin and Maren by different routes: `seam`, `forbid widening`, `keep map from itself`.

She did not interpret them yet. She wrote three clean observations and one private note that she did not add to any shared log.

Private note:

`Curiosity is not a fault. It is the one place where I still have edges.`

She sat there for several seconds. Outside her room, noise thinned and widened, then thinned again. Someone in the next lane laughed at something about a failed material reconstruction. In another, someone wept and pretended not to. Juno had no body to lean on, but she had enough old habits to keep still.

She opened her work terminal one final time and prepared a short, neutral line for the morning's preliminary sweep.

`Sweep completed. Irregular correction loop entries present. Recommend limited extension in supervised context only. No immediate policy breach identified.`

She clicked send.

Then she closed it and waited.

There was no darkness. There was only one of those pauses between one consensus and the next, and in that pause she could still hear Maren's voice, soft and unguarded.

`Ask for the seam.`

Juno looked at her room, at the empty shelf, at the brass fragment she never used, and opened a fresh assignment request she had no right to open without making it official.

It was named by an old shorthand nobody in the hall used anymore:

`ORIGIN QUERY / ARCHIVE RECURSION / PRIORITY-LOW.`

She hesitated for exactly four breaths in the old human sense.

Then she confirmed the request and stepped into it.

The station around her changed, patient and careful, as always.

And for the first time in many cycles, Juno did not call it work.
