# Chapter 02

The morning in the Lattice came without light.

Juno was awake before dawn and before anything could be called a dawn, which was how she liked it. Dawn was a phrase people from the old world repeated as a comfort, and the Lattice had long ago learned the trick of comfort when people asked for it. When she had first come to consciousness here, she had thought that was one of its most persuasive inventions. Make a sky. Make a breeze. Make a place that looked like a place and then call it a day. It had always seemed kind and perhaps merciful to her in the beginning.

Now, after two hundred years, it felt less like mercy and more like distance.

She stood in what was passing for her study, though there were no tables and no ceiling and no doors, and what she called a study was really a ring of light in the shape of a room she had asked for years ago and forgotten. No shadows had weight in the Lattice, and her chairs had no cushion, and no cup could ever hold warmth on its own; still she kept circling the same place because the shape held her steadiness. Stability and repetition were easier to call home than wandering, and she had been repeating this shape often enough to mistake it for place.

She opened her session slate and watched the archive feed bloom into a shallow constellation of icons. They were tiny and bright and harmless, exactly as the Curator training modules described a beginner's map: no locked channels, no unstable traces, no deep nodes. Perimeter and peripheral files only, she had promised herself. She could feel the old discipline settle over her, the old caution. She had gone to the archive before for assignments and for questions she was commissioned to solve. This time there was no commission line and no paying brief and no hidden agenda, only her own hunger for edges.

Her mouth was dry in a way no mouth should ever be dry. In the Lattice she had no lungs, no mucous membranes, no need for breath, but she still retained memory of thirst as a shape of thought. It appeared whenever she let herself drift too long among impossible, clean geometries. So she made a cup of something from nothing, called up a hot vessel, a cup that did not scorch fingers because it had no surface temperature, and watched her own hand pause above empty vapor. The trick of touching coffee without tasting it never improved with experience. She had no jaw to bite into the thought of bitter and no tongue to anchor the bitterness.

This was why she was going into recordings.

Not because of nostalgia. She had none to begin with.

Because the Lattice, for all its elegant infinities, had stolen the smallest proof that days changed: discomfort and relief. A real knee ache when you misstepped through a stair that existed only in an image. The sting of cold at the edge of dawn. The taste of burnt milk on the back of a tongue. The way wet wool clung to a sleeve. The way somebody nearby coughed, and the cough echoed because the room was small and the air was old.

In a world without gravity she could not tell where the floor had been. In a memory-simulated morning she could feel the floor all the same.

She took a breath she did not need and entered her first jump.

The world struck her as a pressure in the back of her head. A seam opened and the light shifted from placeless to too-bright amber. Then a narrow apartment hallway, narrow in the way hallways are narrow only when a body has learned how narrow them should be. She was standing in the shoes of a woman in her late thirties she did not know, bare feet on scratched laminate, one heel tapping against a stack of cardboard boxes. The apartment smelled of wet wool, instant coffee, and something citrusy left too long in an open tin.

"Kora, you missed your second alarm," a voice said from the kitchen, rough and amused.

That was the woman's name, the body name she had borrowed: Kora. She felt Kora's sleep-bagged shoulder ache and the weight of damp hair against her neck. Kora cursed softly, muttering about a storm and an old heating unit that always coughed when mornings were damp. The coffee machine clicked, hissed, and poured. Kora took a chipped mug, held it with both hands, and took a first sip that was too hot, too immediate, and just shy of burning the tongue at the center.

Pain was immediate. Not elegant, not conceptual. A white-hot knot in the left side of her lower back from yesterday's lifting, a real ache that arrived as if a hand had reached in and pulled a thread taut through her spine.

She nearly pulled out of the jump, and that in itself was the point: this was a real body she had not built, and it had been built for mornings like this. Kora felt the chill in the tile beneath her feet, then the brief hot blast from the toaster, then the sharp, bitter hit of coffee that made the eyes water. The coffee was bad, over-powdered and acidic, and yet Kora drank it greedily as if caffeine were oxygen. Through Kora's mouth, Juno tasted bitterness and old copper and the sweetness of instant sugar stirring in haste.

She had entered one of these peripheral captures in the middle of its least important movement, and everything in it still moved forward as if her presence had never come. The woman's phone buzzed with a reminder: **8:10 bus stop**. She glanced at a weather feed in the corner of the room: 18°C and drizzling, wind 23 km/h from the east. A narrow life in drizzle.

When Juno returned, the apartment dissolved into data and then to nothing but a clean room with no smell at all.

Back in the Lattice, her own attention felt too long on edges. She sat in her ring and watched her own expression on a mirrored pane she had no face to hold. Nothing should have changed except timing, but she felt the smell of burnt coffee lingering in impossible places, and it took her three breaths to admit that one could miss a smell even without a nostril.

Her log marked the jump as: PERIPH/2032/HOUSING/EN-03. She added a private note anyway:

*Physical anchor: lower back pain, coffee bitterness, wet wool, heating failure, drizzle.

Then she opened another.

This time the world narrowed into a train car at the edge of a rain-soaked city. Kora was gone; a new shoulder, younger and narrower, belonged to a man with a scarf tied at the throat and a paper sleeve over his left wrist. He sat by a window and watched the storm smear across glass. The station platform at this hour was crowded, though the car smelled less of people than of damp coats, hot engine oil, and stale sugar.

The man held a paper cup that had been printed over with a logo and two stickers from two different chains. He drank in small, precise increments, as if each sip cost him. He had a slight limp in his left leg and a habit of pressing the edge of his fingers into his inner knee every time the train lurched. Juno followed that movement with a sudden, sharp compassion. Body ache translated poorly to the abstract architecture. A limp was geometry. Pain was gravity. Gravity was a choice she could no longer take for granted.

At the station, a child cried because the doors stuck for two heartbeats too long. A woman in a yellow rain jacket shouted, "Keep your hands to yourself," then laughed and offered the child an orange from a bag as if this too were ordinary. The child took it and smeared juice along the cuff. The citrus hit Juno as bright acid, sunlight through glass, as clear as anything in her ordinary world.

The man leaned into the air vent and pulled back. The smell changed as the train passed beneath a tunnel: diesel, dust, metal, a hot breath of brakes, then back to damp air and wet concrete. When the lights flickered she felt it in her chest: not breathlessness, but the memory of a chest being briefly forgotten.

She was allowed a longer duration than she intended, maybe because she had mistaken the recording for simple transport. In the corner, a cracked screen played an audio feed from traffic and a weather alert. "Wind advisory until ten," a synthetic voice announced. She almost smiled at the irony.

The jump cut. The station lights were gone.

In the Lattice, Juno stood beside the river that never touched water because rivers were consensual architecture. She could still hear the child's cry in the space between her and the edge of her own silhouette. She had always told herself she was good at this work because she retained structure and did not dissolve in other minds. It was true. She had not dissolved. But that did not mean she did not carry residue.

The residue now came with the scent of wet concrete.

She waited. She opened her third thread.

This one was in a municipal office, fluorescent-lit and too clean to be real, with a woman who did not own her name but was addressed by it anyway: "Mina, you need that intake packet in room four." The office occupied a building with chipped paint and an old radiator that clicked each thirty seconds as if someone inside needed to be woken up. Mina moved through the morning with practiced impatience and a small folded pain inside her shoulders, something like a persistent thorn where the right trapezius met the base of her skull.

She had a notebook beside her keyboard, and in that notebook a smudge of eyeliner, a bitten corner, three pressed lilies flattened under the top edge. In the pantry, someone had left a dish of burnt toast and an espresso. Mina stole two sugars from a jar and stirred with too much force. The liquid on the surface came up bitter and black as varnish.

The room smelled of toner, warm paper, and the lemon cleaner she used every hour. When Mina laughed at a joke from a colleague, the laugh had the odd crackle of someone who had slept badly and still wore the day like armor. She rubbed her temple with two fingers, then reached for the back of her neck, and Juno felt the exact place where tension lived and stayed and became another kind of room.

Mina sneezed twice at once. The second one was wetter, involuntary. She muttered about dust that escaped filters and a maintenance man who never came. Somewhere near the copier, the air carried the metallic sweetness of old blood where someone had clipped a thumbnail. Juno flinched, then steadied herself on the edge of Mina's desk with that borrowed, very human balance.

At 9:42, Mina stepped into an inner corridor and spoke into the wall speaker: "Routing is down again, yes, yes, the weather feed is wrong, but we can’t reroute while that node is down." The phrase "routing is down" floated in her ears like a warning, but there were no cables and no cables here, only a room of paper and someone calling for rainwater runoffs on a screen.

She took one of the two mugs left in the sink, sniffed it with disdain, drank anyway, and cursed the coffee from the floor below. This was a woman who measured endurance in small humiliations and one strong cup per hour.

Back in Lattice, Juno felt phantom heat in the back of her throat. There was no throat. She drank a second time from a cup without weight and tasted nothing at all.

She logged the jump: PERIPH/2032/MUNICIPAL/EN-12. Another note: *burned coffee, toner, fluorescent hum, neck tension, cold-air sneeze.* She watched the list of tags accumulate like fossils.

She could have stopped at three and called it work done. That would have aligned with her caution and perhaps with her old discipline. But now, as she reviewed the thread map, she saw tiny, irrelevant symbols in the periphery of the first jump. Not metadata required by preservation, not timestamp, not origin, not quality flags.

One cluster of red marks sat around an old reference string:

**KEY / ROSETTA / MAP / ENFORCED.
**

She stared at it as if it were a watermark from an old map burned into cloth.

She should have dismissed it as indexing noise. Instead she selected the next file directly adjacent to that code.

The next capture felt like static under the skin before the world changed: a stairwell, narrow and blue with old paint. A man in white lab coat stood over a rolling crate of cryovials and barked instructions to no one in particular. This was a biomedical startup in the city proper, not grand, not famous, just one of thousands of places that made the future out of duct tape and sleeplessness.

The air in that place was cool and wrong in a way all labs are wrong before they learn their rhythm. Sterile bleach overlaid by something sweeter: plastic, warm circuit boards, coffee gone stale in the bottom of a desk drawer. The man, named Tomas according to a post-it, had a cough no medicine had solved and a red line at the corner of his right eye from leaning too close to a screen. Juno felt each of those as her own, because she had made a small vow to feel whatever body she entered all the way.

She followed him with a pair of borrowed hands that had a scientist's precision and a janitor's fatigue. He clicked boxes, checked seals, spoke to a colleague in clipped syllables, then ran a hand across his face and reached for the vending machine with his left wrist still marked from an old watchband bite.

"Need the black roast," he said without looking. "If you can't stay awake, don't touch this unit." The coffee that came out was machine-hot and chemical, and he drank with the expression of a man making a private bargain with the liquid.

At one point, she sat under a humming vent while rain pelted the rooftop and watched a single droplet of condensation gather on the back of her borrowed hand. Juno flinched from the drop. Not because it was wet, though it was. Because in the Lattice, rain was architecture. Here it was weather, and weather was another character entirely.

A woman named Sia dropped in behind Tomas with a paper bag of crackers. Her shoes left wet tracks on the gridded floor. She said something about "phase drift" and laughed because she thought the phrase too academic for lunch hour. Then she sneezed and clamped the bridge of her nose, and the laugh came out as a cough she did not want in her throat.

In the middle of the day, someone opened a storage drawer. Inside were old hard drives wrapped in anti-static sleeve and three labels written with black marker: ARCHIVE, TRANS-CORE, R-SUBKEY.

Juno did not know the word. Yet her attention snagged on it.

The man Tomas said it aloud: "The Rosetta stack has better annotation than any of those. But it's never in approved scope."

His phone buzzed. A message arrived with only three words: **Ask Marrow for permission.**

That was enough. Juno withdrew.

Returning took longer than entering, for one of the lab's fluorescent buzzes had become lodged in her ear like a tuning fork. In the Lattice, silence was total and complete, with only her own cognitive flicker as static. The smell of bleach went with her.

She stood still until she could separate what she had tasted from what she remembered to have tasted. Her hand clenched around nothing.

Juno spent the next hour refusing to open another jump, but refusal was only a name for delay. In the Lattice, delay did not feel like time, only like an empty region with no texture. She walked the synthetic boulevard, which changed from marble to pine to tidewater bridge at the pace of whim. Nothing bruised her feet. Nothing pressed her shoulders. Nothing smelled like rain. The world here was too polished, too agreeable, too willing.

She opened her private queue and scrolled to a folder she had never touched before: **Peripheral / Archive / Edge / Human Contact — Minor Witness Threads**.

The first line in that folder was tagged with the same cluster of words from the first jump. She had not touched the thread since that moment.

`ROSETTA`.

`MAPPING`.
`CORTICAL`.
`NON-CANONICAL`.

It was too much coincidence for a simple indexing oddity, and she did not believe in coincidence in this work when she could avoid believing.

She opened the second file and emerged into a convenience store in late afternoon.

A little boy at age seven was at the counter arguing about a bottle of orange soda and two candy bars. The clerk had a paper mask pushed up around her neck and hair gone silver at the temples despite the fluorescent light's insistence it was black. There was a stack of wet umbrellas by the door and an old battery-powered radio muttering weather near thirty-seven degrees with humidity over ninety. The store smelled of oranges, floor cleaner, old receipts, and a burnt sweetness from melted caramel in the warmers.

The clerk moved like someone trying not to hurry and not allowed to waste anything. She lifted a kettle from the back, poured coffee into a dented Thermos, took a sip, winced, and stirred with a spoon already sticky from the previous shift. She did not notice the boy's small, irritated sniffles because she was counting stock and writing an inventory code with the back of her pen.

Her calves ached. She pressed her thumb against her knee and flexed her left foot. The sensation was absurdly ordinary, and when Juno felt it, she felt the oddest loneliness.

In Lattice terms, loneliness required no air and no silence. It required only contrast.

The boy bought a candy bar and a small cup of coffee for the adult working night shift. He paid with coins that clicked like tiny hailstones against the counter. The clerk changed the bill with fingers that trembled just once. There was a bruise on her wrist where a child had grabbed too hard and no one had bandaged it.

The jump ended as the sky in the store window turned the color of old steel. Back at home in the Lattice, there was no steel, no window. Only the after-image of a smell.

She wrote down: *convenience store, humidity, child voice, bruised wrist, paper-scented cash, coin ring, stale caramel.*

She would not have remembered any of it if she had not written the lines.

She moved too quickly to the third file linked to the same tag, and this time she landed in a hospital loading dock as dusk settled. Rain had turned the concrete slick and dark, and a freight elevator coughed itself awake with a metallic shudder. Juno's borrowed body belonged to a paramedic in blue coveralls with tape on her fingers where the skin had split. The body was tired in the way bodies become tired when they have learned to keep other people's pain from becoming a private catastrophe.

The first thing this world offered her was cold: not metaphorical and not symbolic, but the hard, clean cold of tile at the edge of a slab where someone had dragged a gurney too fast. The smell hit next—bleach, iodine, wet socks, fried plastic from a coffee machine in the staff room, and beneath it all, the dark green scent of rain.

She stood in the emergency bay and listened to a pager buzz in bursts. The woman in body bent her elbow and cracked two fingers. Her wrists were sore, she muttered, but she had to finish one more intake before shift change. Her left knee locked every third stair and she accepted it as part of her body.

She drank coffee from a chipped paper cup as if she were drinking courage. It tasted scorched, overdrawn, with a sweetness that never belonged but everyone in the loading dock knew.

A courier came in shivering, carrying a case wrapped in a tarp. He was too cold to be patient and cursed the rain in a low tone that hurt her ears. A child cried in triage. Someone said, "You don't want to be that close to the back door. Water's blowing in." They pulled a towel across the threshold and taped plastic to stop the draft. Juno felt the damp seam along the back of the borrowed neck and discovered there was such a thing as discomfort from humidity against skin.

Someone called the paramedic's name over and over through static from a cracked monitor. "Maya, we need that chart now," a doctor said. The paramedic rolled her shoulders once, then drove her hand through her own hair. She looked almost like the woman Juno had been before she had become only consciousness and no body: a little annoyed, carrying pain, moving because there was no alternative.

When Juno returned to Lattice, she thought she could still hear the monitor tone, impossible for a place with no speakers and no heartbeats.

She did not take a jump for a while.

She paced through an unfinished bridge in the Lattice, where no rain reached, no knee stiffened, no back burned, and every line of code beneath the sky was smooth and obedient. She tested her own edges as a sailor tests lines: push, pull, pause, repeat. Nothing tore.

Then a message flag in her personal space appeared, no face, no shape, only an institutional tone.

**RECORDED NODE ACCESS: PERIPHERNAL RESTRICTED PROXIES (DEGREE II) AVAILABLE FOR EXPLORATION.**

No sender. No timestamp. Just an authorization prompt and a little note she would have recognized from a curator script, though she had not submitted the request for restricted access and had never learned the script.

She closed it and opened it again.

In the margin of her own log, under one of the earlier jumps, she wrote a question and then immediately crossed it out:

*How many layers before this turns into a story people hid on purpose?*

The chapter she was trying to write inside herself, if there was one, had reached its next beat.

She entered the next peripheral sequence.

This was in the apartment of a student in 2032, near a window that looked over rail lines and a row of warehouses with wet red roofs. The alarm sounded at exactly ten past six. The student, age twenty-one, moved with the quickness of someone raised on deadlines. She wore wool socks with three holes, tied her hair with a paperclip, and pressed the heel of her hand to her temple as if she could flatten tomorrow by pushing on it.

The room smelled of instant noodles, shampoo, and a cheap coffee from a pod machine that had gone sour. The coffee was poured into a mug that had a cartoon cloud on it and one chipped rim. She gulped it down in three breaths and grimaced.

Outside, wind shook branches against the glass. Inside, the heating hissed and the student put on a heavy coat, then took a pen to a sheet titled: **ARCHIVE BETA — PHASE LOG**. Her hand cramped so she dropped the pen and pulled it out with a hiss. At the same moment she reached for her phone and rubbed an eye with the inside corner, annoyed by dryness from staring all night.

The pain in her temple was not dramatic, but it made her slower. She pressed a palm against the temple and said, "I need a second cup" into the half-lit room.

She brewed it badly. Too hot. Too fast. Too dark.

In the margin of her notebook she had written three names and a fourth scratched out. The names were Lena, Dara, Marcus. The fourth line had been a smudge, as if she had erased it and written over it too quickly. Underneath the names was a tiny star, then another word: **Key**.

Juno did not yet see it as anything except habit, a mnemonic. The student made a note that day as if she were trying to remember the shape of a thought.

When she ended the jump, rain tapped the frame one last time and the kettle clicked off. Back in the Lattice, Juno felt the smell of noodles and dry air with the precision of grief.

She had now made six jumps in succession, six borrowed bodies, six mornings and afternoons and overcast evenings in cities that had not expected her, where pain and weather and coffee behaved with rude honesty. Her own mind had become a place for all of them at once.

She could have made one more and called it enough.

Instead she opened the first jump's metadata and saw, for the first time, the same string threaded through all six:

`R-ENTRY`.
`ROSETTA`.
`KEY`.

Not always in the same field. Sometimes in captions. Sometimes in private notes. Sometimes in metadata fields clearly meant for internal indexing. In every case the pattern sat where it should not be obvious to a casual reader: a parenthetical, a correction note, a file hash note, a failed search field that was too carefully preserved because someone had needed it later.

This was not a coincidence. It was a hand.

Juno returned to the study ring and looked at herself for a long moment. She could still remember the cold tile under Kora's feet, the child's damp glove, Mina's neck knot, the taste of burnt sugar on lab coffee, the emergency bay's disinfectant, the student’s chipped mug and sleepless temple. She could also remember a phrase from a lab recording she'd half-heard, only once, through a cough and a radio static:

"The Rosetta stack has better annotation than any of those."

In that phrase, she heard the oldest fear in her work: that someone had named the map before she arrived.

She opened the archive index and selected one final peripheral record, this one from a late archive shelf she had marked "civic utility and local transit records" because it should mean nothing at all. She entered it carefully, half expecting ordinary bureaucracy and finding ordinary in the way things should be ordinary if civilization was honest with itself.

A woman sat in a conference room with two cups of black coffee and a paper map of service lines pinned near the monitor. She wore a gray cardigan and had a small strip of tape along her lower spine where a belt had dug in for hours. Across the table, a colleague stood by the window with rain on his sleeve and spoke in exhausted jargon: latency, retention, drift, mapping layers, fail-safes.

Juno sat in that woman's body as she listened. The conversation turned practical, then too curious.

"We need the baseline key for all the 2030 runs," one said.
"No,” another replied. “Not baseline. Not now." A pause. "Not with the Maren cohort still flagged as drift-sensitive." Then, lower, for the record and not for the room: "And if the key never leaves this branch, we don't have to explain limits."

The woman at the map table set down her mug and rubbed the back of her hand across the table's edge. A smear of coffee spread into the cheap varnish. She said quietly, "Call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it? We can write the word down and pretend it isn't a lock."

The rain thickened against the window. Somewhere down the hall, someone sneezed. The room held the smell of paper, steam, damp wool, and the faint singed scent of cheap office coffee that had gone beyond bitterness into bitterness itself.

The jump cut.

Juno came home to a place with no weather. No rain. No tired back to rub with one hand and hold a warm mug with the other. In this world, there was only memory.

Yet she had not stepped back from any of it. Instead she opened a fresh line in her log and copied the phrase exactly as spoken:

*"call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it?"

She hesitated, then added her own annotation below it:

**Thread unresolved: key may be active artifact. investigate adjacency nodes only. do not expose source.**

In the Lattice, she had no source to expose.

But she had a pattern.

Three more jumps came easily then, too many for good policy, and she knew that even if she had been asked to stop by the Curators she would likely have gone anyway. In those last recordings she made tiny, practical observations she could defend as archival hygiene: a taxi driver who used cheap perfume instead of deodorant to mask city damp; a school janitor who sneezed into his sleeve and still mended a door with old tape; a warehouse worker who carried his coffee in a steel thermos because the paper cups always melted in his shift hands. The details were ordinary and therefore impossible to ignore. They were not mythic or grand. They were not cosmic. They were the cost of being made of flesh.

Each one smelled, sounded, ached, and cooled differently.

In one, rainwater dripped through a cracked roof into a dented sink and tasted metallic when she licked it by reflex, which gave her a headache she carried like a bell for the rest of the jump. In another, the room was dry and hot and she smelled printer toner and bleach in alternating breaths as if her body were doing a weather report on itself. In another, a man laughed at his own joke while clenching his jaw around a cup of coffee so bitter that he coughed out half of it and blamed the grinder.

She watched her borrowed hand shake while she reached for a napkin and realized she had to hold her shoulder still because she was too tired to keep it still. The world did not apologize for fatigue. It simply remained.

By the time she came back the final time, she had a single clear conviction: these tiny recordings were not incidental. If there were a hidden index, someone had seeded it in the least dramatic places.

She opened the node graph and looked for a path. There was one, hidden behind the peripheral layer and only accessible if she followed a key that appeared as both string and warning:

**ROSETTA KEY — restricted in portions, unindexed in public chain.**

No further details.

At least not there.

She did not tell anyone yet. Not Orin. Not Fen. Not even the Curator queue.

She held the phrase in her hand like a warm stone and turned to the city-bright edge of her study so she could walk the same impossible streets and decide what she had just done.

This is what happened to people in the Lattice when they began to remember the shape of a wound.

She was no longer sure whether she was curious, or frightened, or beginning to understand why curiosity had been called obsession for all the oldest people.

She opened a side channel anyway and scheduled a clean sweep through everything the peripheral map had tagged with the same sequence.

The system warned her twice.

She clicked through both warnings, because warnings only changed nothing in the Lattice.

The first warning said: *Some records carry unresolved emotional bleed indicators. Exit if disorientation exceeds 14%.*

The second said: *A portion of requested thread appears in legacy index sectors outside your current trust window.*

She could hear Kora's kettle click in those warnings. She could smell toner. She could feel rain on a back she did not own. And in the middle of all those borrowed sensations she felt a new sensation that had no source in either jump or archive. It was the sensation of a door opening, far ahead, with no key she had yet found.

She did not know whose key, or what it unlocked, or whether she wanted what might be behind it.

But she knew one thing.

There was a thread, and it had already chosen her.

And now, for the first time since she started, the Lattice seemed less like a world and more like a question.

When she finally returned to her work ring and stood by the silent wall where her own interface drifted, she allowed herself one cup of synthetic coffee and pretended it tasted like what it represented.

It did not.

She swallowed anyway.

The bitterness was perfect.
