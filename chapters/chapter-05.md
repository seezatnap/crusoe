# Chapter 5 — Coit Academy and the Sign of One Door

At the beginning of the morning, the fog sat on Haight Street like a thoughtful audience. It gave no applause, no verdict, only a patient hush that made every step sound like a question. Ginny sat up in bed while the rest of the house was still in that in-between state between bed and intention.

She had slept with her sketchbook at the foot of the bed on a second thought, as if the paper might catch something the night had missed. It was a plain brown thing with a blue stripe, the sort of notebook one might buy in Muggle shops and claim to use for recipes. It already held two columns of quick lines in her careful hand: one for street scenes, one for small notations she never explained to anyone.

Downstairs, the house had already entered that particular Weasley vibration between laughter and catastrophe: Molly calling from the kitchen, Arthur pretending he had not found the wrong side of the map, and Percy announcing his voice at a volume that implied all roads had already failed him.

"Please listen," Percy said from the hallway, where he stood beside the stair with a hard-backed notebook and a pen held like a wand of authority. "We are, as I calculated, leaving in eight minutes, with a margin of three."

"That is a magical way to call it a catastrophe," said Ron.

"A practical way," said Percy. "Last summer I took six separate route options to the post office and they all failed because nobody looked at the printed plan. This time I have the route confirmed by Bell and the map, with buffer windows where a Muggle bus strike is probable but not guaranteed."

"No one in this family can guarantee anything in front of a bus," said Fred from below, shouldering a paper sack that looked like it contained socks and conspiracy.

Arthur looked up from his map folder where two diagrams were now trying to defeat one another on the same table. "A map can be a suggestion, Percy. So can a clock. And clocks in this city do not keep the same opinion of the weather."

Percy exhaled and folded the notebook closed as if closing a case at the Ministry. "This is not a suggestion. Today’s schedule includes registration, Coit Academy orientation, Muggle Integration practical, and return before the late fog. That's not optional."

Ginny stepped into the dining room before Molly brought in the tea. Her own notebook was tucked under her arm, as much armour as any wand she did not yet have.

"You taking that to the Academy?" Harry asked softly, reaching for the marmalade.

"To carry a notebook where my brain can’t go fast enough," she said, with what sounded like a joke and was not.

She slid into her chair. The kitchen window fogged from the kettles and the city. Outside, Arthur pointed out two unfamiliar things as if cataloguing them for a taxidermist.

"There’s a sign for a laundromat with a giant octopus in full daylight, and a place that sells bread by the hour. We are not in Britain." He spoke as though this were a miracle and not a fact.

Molly handed out toast and eggs, then gave each child half a loaf in equal slices as if she suspected someone would start bargaining with each other over crumbs by the end of the day. She stopped beside Ginny and lowered her voice.

"You remember when you used your old school books to draw the kitchen before you could spell that right? Keep that mind in it, but keep your head too. Draw what you want. Listen, and don't go wandering too far alone. You can call for me if this place gets sharp." 

"This is a school trip," Arthur said around a sip of tea. "She’s coming along."

"With one eye on her sketchbook and one on her shoes," Molly said. "That is acceptable for Ginny."

"Only one condition," said Percy. "There will be no detours in Chinatown and no extended conversations with unauthorized adults."

“Authorizing adults sounds expensive,” said George.

“Unauthorized adults are one of the three great causes of magical exposure,” Percy replied.

"And curiosity," said Harry, mouth full.

Molly glared with affectionate disapproval at all three. "Eat first. Then discuss civilization."

By the time they set out, the fog had lifted into narrow bright shafts that made the street appear newly polished. The family crossed to the tram stop where Arthur had to explain twice that he would absolutely survive the fare if he pressed the coin on the correct side.

"Could we do this without the map?" Ginny asked Percy once they were in the tram, the city moving in quick sideways slides through wet glass.

"If we did, we would all be late in a different way." Percy offered. "No, no detours. We are visiting Coit because we’re not here for a holiday, Harry; we are here to gather evidence of how this place behaves. I’m not saying to enjoy it, only to observe it without panic."

"You do know observations can be enjoyable," said Ron, who had been staring at the cable system above with the expression of a boy who had discovered architecture and terror in equal measure.

"At this moment, observation without a timeline is panic in disguise," said Percy.

Harry hid a smile. The tram clattered down a slope, and Ginny watched the city open in front of them: warehouses, murals, bright signs, then the ghostlike tower-like silhouette of Coit on the hill. She had never liked how Coit looked before. It always seemed either like a monument and a warning at once.

Arthur leaned forward, delighted with every second. "There it is! Look at those moving lines. If they can put an entire building into shape as a lighthouse for fog and still pretend it is a thing that only tourists photograph, that is some kind of wizardry."

"And some kind of muggle engineering with a good PR department," said Bill, deadpan.

By the time the tram door folded open at the top of the incline, the Weasleys were breathing in unison with the city crowd: tourists and local students, old women with umbrellas, two children carrying glowing maps on little devices, a baritone laugh from somewhere that sounded like rain on a barrel. The Academy building loomed beside them like a dark, friendly fortress that had discovered concrete and then apologized for it.

At first glance it seemed to be a narrow stack of platforms, steel and glass wrapped around a stone core that caught the fog and made it look older. A brass plate near the entry read: **Coit Academy of Practical Magic — Regional Practical Cohort Center**. Below in smaller script was something Ginny only half read while keeping an eye on the fog moving like wool through the entry. **No sorting ceremonies. No house banners. Check in, work in teams, register your projects.**

Arthur stopped in front of the entrance and looked at the brass words as if they had personally offended him.

"No house banners," he said. "I know this is America and all, but no house banners makes me sad for everyone’s ego"

Ginny almost laughed and reached for her notebook. The fog behind the plate had gathered itself around a thin white line that looked, for a moment, like a drawn symbol. Then the shape dissolved and she blinked.

Percy had already gone to a side table and was producing papers as if this were a Ministry counter where people had to prove they were not a conspiracy at the turnstile. A receptionist in a dark cardigan looked up and smiled the way adults smile when they want your compliance and your confidence.

"Morning," she said. "You’re the family from the Weasleys? We were expecting you by letter."

"Yes, yes," Percy answered before anyone else could. "Arthur, Molly, and children. We have an orientation slot with regional liaison at nine-oh-two and Muggle Integration at nine-twenty-five. I have submitted temporary registration forms."

"I’m sure you have," said the woman, and she slid a card across the counter. "But I need an updated list from each adult in case of legal updates. American practice says one set of forms for all visitors, one set for field children, and one set for adults who look as if they might correct us in public."

"This is a school," said George under his breath.

The woman smiled without slowing. "Welcome anyway. There’s a hall to your right for first-name orientation and a practical locker room. Bring your coats inside your trust circles. No wand pointing at signs. They bite." She pointed at the small symbol above the elevator shaft, and Ginny watched the shape at the edge of her vision again, a curve with three short arms and a central gap.

"Did she just point to the symbol?" Ginny whispered to herself.

She felt ridiculous, because everyone else was discussing paperwork as if this was a matter of civic necessity and not wonder. She added one careful stroke to her notebook: a line curled inward, a bar below, a broken point at the top.

"Ginny," said Arthur, already trying to help two boys carry his bag and two coats at once. "You want to keep up at least for the hall, yes? We may not be running a gallery in here."

She nodded and followed.

Inside the entrance hall there were no tapestries of founders, no portraits pretending to enforce tradition. Instead there were benches, practical lockers, and a wall of notices in marker pen.

"Check-in, then corridor two," said a student volunteer with a badge that read **N. Ortiz — Cohort Mentor, Year 2**. "You’ll be split into cohorts by age and interest. No forms for house points. Keep your own inventory and don’t wander into the old lift shafts."

"Old lift shafts?" said Ron.

"They’re still under renovation," said a younger girl in a yellow jacket who had silver earrings shaped like stars. "Or because we are under the weather and it’s hard to tell." She gave them a bright look and then turned away as if she had done her part in an old ritual.

The hall door opened into a room with no dais, no raised platform, and no teacher standing behind an oversized desk. Instead, half the students sat in circles with whiteboards on wheeled stands.

A teacher with close-cut silver hair and a broad black belt tied around her waist looked up from a tray of notes and smiled, no more ceremonious than one might smile at a kettle that had just boiled over.

"You’re late if you were keeping Hogwarts time," she called. "If you’re keeping your own, you’re fine. I’m Tori Bell. We use first names everywhere unless someone is trying to annoy each other, in which case everyone is still on first-name terms."

She tapped the board and nodded to the group. "Welcome to Coit. We’re practical because this city is damp and stubborn and full of people who will not wait for your spell if you can do it with a map and patience. This is Muggle Integration: your job this morning is to learn the difference between legal, awkward, and useful."

The class laughed because it was funny and maybe also because they all recognized themselves in those categories.

"And this is Mr…?" asked Fred, then blushed because Percy gave him a sharp look.

"No 'Mr.,'" said Tori. "You all have surnames if you want. But if we’re pretending this is a ministry office, you can leave all of your dignity at the coat rack, and take it out when you leave."

Ron glanced at Ginny and shrugged. Harry’s mouth tightened in amusement. Bill folded his arms and looked as if he trusted the setup already.

"And here," said Tori, writing on the board, "is the way to use the city for an errand without becoming a headline."

She drew a quick schema of roads, bus routes, and icon symbols they would all later have to decode. Then she split the students into teams by mixed age.

"No houses, no headsman, no prefects,” she said. “Your mentor this morning is the team, not a grade. If you fail, you fail in company and you get another chance. You tell each other what you did wrong, then fix it. If you cast a spell in Muggle space, it must pass one test: can a sensible person repeat what you did and accept ownership?"

Percy raised a hand the way someone does when trying to be efficient. "Excuse me, Miss Tori. Is there a formal attendance log with cohort signatures for compliance?"

Tori nodded at him with theatrical patience. "In this class, yes. You have until twenty minutes in. If you sign too early, you lose the chance to correct spelling errors on your own forms."

He looked relieved and offended in equal measure.

Ginny sat beside Harry and tried to make notes that looked like notes but were mostly symbols and arrows. She wrote the first word *no houses*, then circled it and crossed it with *what now?*.

A lanky student to her left slid a folded sheet across the table. "I’m Kalen," he said. "You’re with the UK contingent? Your coat says it."

"And your accent says this city hates me less than your symbols," said Ginny.

Kalen grinned. "We should be kinder in the first term. It helps everybody find the room in fog."

The class moved to practical stations: bus token kiosks, an elevator panel, a public stair emergency map, a mock café counter with three buttons that made bells ring in different tones.

"Task one," Tori said. "You need to cross three streets, order a hot drink without magic, and leave with the change without dropping your wallet. For every one of you who thinks this is beneath your skill, your score is now zero."

"That is deeply insulting," said Fred.

"That is deeply educational," said George.

“Will I get one of my parents’ Muggle coins?” asked Ron.

“Use your own,” said Tori. “Or borrow from someone with better luck. We’re not here for your family coin policy.”

They followed her through a door into a narrow hall that smelled faintly of citrus cleaner and raincoats. On the wall above a set of stairs was a brass plate with the same curled mark Ginny had drawn, now clearer than before: a loop, three short arms, a notch like a bite at the edge. It seemed too deliberate for decorative work.

She slowed, took out her pencil, and made a second version in the notebook: the same shape, but with extra notches at each arm, because she wasn’t sure what it meant and had made an unconscious change from shape to idea.

"Ginny," called Ron, "Muggle Integration only requires us to get home. We’re not here to map architecture."

"Then we are doing it wrong," said George.

She looked up and gave him a conspiratorial grimace. "I’m drawing the signs so we don’t get lost in fog with a bad memory and a bad turn of nerve."

He nodded, then to the class at large said, "Look, she has a point."

Tori Bell made a stop at the same wall, touched the plate with one finger, and asked, "Anyone know why this symbol recurs in service routes?"

Several hands went up.

"Decorative,” said one student.

"Old city maintenance marker,” said another.

"Could be ward reinforcement.”

Ginny’s hand rose before she decided. "Could be both," she said.

Tori’s smile sharpened with interest but did not promise certainty. "Could be both, and we will let that sit. If we know whether that distinction matters, we can ask someone in the right department. If this were a decorative motif, it would not always face the same direction. Most of these are from one of the city wards. Remember that, but don’t dramatize it yet."

The class moved on.

At the mock café station, Percy stood apart with his watch and a small notebook that looked like a legal indictment. When Harry reached for a cup and handed coins over correctly, Percy appeared at his elbow.

"We are running forty seconds over," he said.

"We are still in a class,” said Arthur, appearing from somewhere else, balancing three coat baskets and a package of biscuits he had just bought from a corridor window because he had mistaken the shape for an edible. “If we are late, we are late to learning, not to war.”

"Late is late," said Percy. "We have another event block."

"Did they issue us this room for event blocking?” asked Fred.

"I’m recording these interactions for family safety," Percy said. "If someone goes missing we have a log of last movement."

Harry watched Ginny’s expression; she was trying very hard to look amused instead of annoyed.

"My brother means to make sure we can still find each other if the fog turns evil," Arthur said quietly. “Take it as a kindness, not a law.”

Tori noticed the tension and clapped once, not for attention but for reset. "If someone is worried about timing, your concern is valid. If someone is worried about the class, your concern is valid too. Keep your concern in the same circle and let the map do its own timekeeping."

Percy frowned but held his pen down.

Muggle Integration continued in pairs. Harry with Ginny, Percy with George, Fred with Kalen, Ron with another student named Mara who had a quick smile and a severe braid. Bill and Marisol's local friend from Fog Hollow were not part of the class this morning, but Marisol had sent a short note through a cousin: *ask first, assume nothing, keep notes*.

Ginny and Harry were assigned a station called **Public Space Protocol**. A projected projection showed footage of a crowded Muggle market intersection with multiple buses arriving at once.

"Step one," said Tori, "You are here. You spot a lost tourist. You can’t just summon a cart and drag them out. You need to ask two questions, use one route, and avoid alarming them."

"And if he asks us to cast a charm to move the stroller?”, asked Harry.

"Then you decline politely,” said Ginny.

"How politely?” said Harry.

"Polite enough that they ask again," said Ginny.

He laughed at that and took a seat at the station. They practised with the projection and the timer, and every time Harry said the polite refusal he did so with a different rhythm, finding a way to sound older and kinder at the same time.

In one simulation, a virtual train announcement came on, and a little icon for emergency services flashed.

"What is this line?” Tori asked. “What do you do if the alarm sounds and you can’t cast?"

"Call for human help," said Harry without pause.

"And what is human help here?”

"People,” Harry said, which made Ron and Fred, nearby, look at each other with appreciation.

Ginny wrote: *Muggle systems are not for us; they are for everybody, including us.*

At lunch, Percy called everybody together and held up his schedule card like an altar lamp.

"Lunch break is exactly forty minutes and ends at 11:45," he said. “At 11:46 we head for the archival corridor and orientation on transit etiquette. Please do not linger near the stairwell for photos.”

"And yet if someone wants a photo,” said Fred, “is that considered lingering or education?”

"Education,” said Ginny, already halfway to her seat.

"Exactly," said Harry. “It can be both if you write it down.”

Percy was not smiling. "I am not opposed to photos. I am opposed to being late for the next room because one cousin wanted to pose in fog." He glanced at Arthur, then at Bill, as if expecting support from whichever one looked more manageable.

Marlowe Hall had an upper cafeteria with long windows and coffee steam that smelled like both burnt sugar and wet wool. At one table, a group of students were sharing a bowl and discussing some local transit code as if it were a card game.

Ginny took her tray of soup and toast, sat near the far window, and placed her notebook beside her water cup. She had almost forgotten the symbol when the tray rattled from a bump in the floor. Her pen slid and drew a clean line down the margin. She paused and looked up.

On the back wall above the recycling station, there it was again: the same loop, the same broken top point, the same three small arms. This one had a thin line beneath it, like a base. She felt a little cold despite the warm room.

"You see that too?" she asked Kalen, who was two seats away.

He squinted and took his biscuit in one hand. "The ward plate? Hmm. We’ve got that on two floors, I think. Why?"

"I keep drawing it,” she said.

"You’re not the first,” he said, then lowered his voice. "We have students who see pattern where there is only bureaucracy. But this one keeps ending up where the fog channels run." He didn’t elaborate, and perhaps that meant the thing was obvious.

Ginny took out her pencil and copied the plate, then underlined it, then drew the shape a third time in miniature with small marks at the side.

No one in the room could tell whether she was drawing a symbol or a habit when Percy appeared beside her.

"Lunch is only half-point on one and should be completed by twelve, not twelve-thirty," he said in a voice he hoped was practical and not accusing.

"I know,” she said.

"Are you in danger of not being ready for the next section because of note-taking?”

"I’m taking notes because there is a lot in this place I can’t name," she said.

He considered this as one might consider a legal amendment. “If you see symbols, label them by coordinates. Descriptions do not survive panic. Names do.”

"I could do that,” said Ginny.

He nodded, perhaps satisfied by one obedient point. “And keep your pace with the group.”

Ron and Fred shared a look over trays and said nothing, which was close to a compliment.

The post-lunch session was field-based. The class followed a guide through an older corridor lined with glass and old maps, then out onto a deck that looked almost like an industrial walkway but had windows to a city that moved in layers.

From here, the fog itself became instruction. Tori pointed to a crossing where fog-lifts and stair platforms met.

"You want to go where your feet can return. Not where your charm tells you to go. In this city, a clever charm can still drown you if you forget where the old water runs," she said.

A student asked if that was a metaphor.

"No," Tori replied. "That happened."

The group split into pairs and practiced a small set of route exercises: identify accessible entries, leave clear messages at waypoints, never cast to override a Muggle alarm if a manual route exists.

Ginny and Harry were sent to a lower stairwell where the city’s steel ribs were exposed. She watched fog thread through the vents and felt, just for a breath, the same pressure in the air she had felt on a few nights in Fog Hollow where everyone pretended the weather was normal. The shape came back to her in three places at once, each a little different: one carved into brass at the level of waist height, one painted on a pillar cap, one painted so faintly it might have been a trick of reflection.

She made notes with urgency now, arrows and letters and a line that linked each observed point to “FOG-LANE,” “LOW PLATFORM,” and “WEST TURN.”

"You making treasure map?” asked Harry quietly.

"Something like that," she said. “No, worse. Maybe a warning map.”

"No worse,” said Harry. “Useful. We can check whether all the warnings have the same weather.”

She smiled at him and kept writing.

Back in the hall, Tori brought the class together and projected a final map of a Muggle district.

"You have forty seconds to plan a route, get a needed object for one family, and return with receipt language that won’t get the shopkeeper into trouble and won’t get you into Ministry trouble," she said.

Everyone groaned and laughed in the same breath. Percy leaned into the challenge like a man receiving his kingdom.

"What are the scoring rules?” he asked, which in this room felt like a person from another system.

"No score," said Tori. “But every route gets a review and if everyone gets trapped in fog at the same time, we restart. In this school, errors are data."

Ginny glanced at her hands and realized they were smudged with pencil and graphite because she had drawn too many lines. She had also drawn the symbol again at the top of the last page, now with three possible variations. None looked exactly right. She underlined each and wrote: **seen again: stairwell / corridor / deck marker**.

After the practicals, there was a short conversation called **cohort check-in** where students said one useful thing they learned and one thing that still frightened them. There were no prefect badges and no formal ranking. A student with a freckled face admitted she had been scared to ask directions in a crowd without spell support and learned she could ask three questions and listen.

When Ron’s turn came, he said, quite softly, "My fear is that I spend so long keeping track for everyone else, I may forget to keep my own footing."

Ginny listened and wrote nothing at first because that was not about symbol; it was about him, and she had never seen him speak that way about himself.

Percy came forward and said, "I worry that in emergencies families become late because there is too much kindness and no sequence." He said sequence like it was prayer.

Arthur said his turn in a sentence too warm to be a confession. "I worry that if we stop being amazed, we stop being ourselves."

Tori only nodded and moved on, as if this was expected.

Then Ginny and Harry traded their position. Harry asked her quietly if she wanted to add anything she had written in the margins.

She hesitated, then opened her notebook. There, below a page of route arrows, was the symbol in four lines, each darker than the last.

"I have seen this mark three times," she said. “I drew it because I didn't understand it. It has no title. It seems to be in service routes and places where fog systems change." 

Harry looked at the shape and didn’t pretend he understood. “You drew that on purpose," he said.

"No one asked me to stop.", said Ginny.

He nodded. “That’s enough. Keep it. If it’s nothing, it’s still practice. If it is something, practice becomes useful.”

Before they could speak more, Percy called everyone back to the main hall.

"We must leave now," he said, smiling with the ferocious discipline of someone holding together a fragile structure. "If we miss the transit demonstration, we miss the map review, and then you all have to explain to your adults why we arrived in a different city than planned."

Ginny raised an eyebrow. "How would that be worse than spending half a day with a class?"

"The adults are already nervous about Muggle timing," he said, and for a moment she saw not anger but fear under it. "It’s easier to explain one delay than many." 

Bill stepped to Percy’s shoulder. "Your schedule is useful, Percy. Maybe just call this delay and keep the log in terms we can all live with." 

Percy softened by a fraction. "I can accept that." He looked at the younger Weasleys and smiled despite himself. "It is not command; it is a way to keep everyone alive." 

The class dissolved into chatter, coats, and umbrellas. Outside, the fog had thickened, and the Academy building looked like it had always been made of river breath and old brass.

Before boarding the tram, Ginny looked once more at the brass plate beside the corridor door where the symbol sat. It seemed almost invisible now. She drew the outline once more from memory anyway, the way you draw a face you cannot shake.
Harry had stepped close enough that he could follow the line with his eyes. He did not say anything, only made a small nod that said he was watching the same shape.

The tram ride back moved slowly through streets where gulls rode the wind and fog turned corners into brief white doors. On the ride, no one talked for the first few stops, and then, as always, talk returned in fragments.

Arthur described the fog-lift model and how much cleaner it would be than a Ministry bureaucracy if only wizards admitted they were using city systems. Marisol’s note pinned in his pocket was passed and repassed. Fred and George compared class scores and decided nobody was actually graded but everyone had been graded.

Percy reviewed his timing once in the mirror, once against the glass, then shut the notebook and leaned back.

"I am trying,” he said to no one in particular, “not to look stupid in front of children who think I am too serious. It is a hard profession.”

"You don’t look stupid,” said Bill.

"No,“ said Percy, “but I look like I might be a notice in the wrong building." 

Harry grinned and gave him the look he had given a man who had done what he could and needed to be believed. "At least you're a clear notice. It helps." 

In the Haight House, Ginny dropped her notebook on the dining table before anyone could assign it a purpose. She sat with her elbow on the wood and reread the final page.

The symbol seemed to change depending on how hard she looked. On one page it looked like a decorative spiral, on another like a three-pronged wave, on another like a key with missing teeth. At the very bottom she had added three short notes from lunch: **FOG-LANE SERVICE**, **WEST PLATFORM**, **STAIRWELL**.

Bill noticed her expression and came into the kitchen. "You found something odd," he said, not as accusation, but as recognition.

"I saw a mark,” she said, sliding the notebook toward him. “Not twice. Not three times. Again and again, same shape, near fog channels and service places." 

Bill looked, then looked to the window where fog had become a narrow strip against the glass. He held the notebook page with the care of someone reading a suspect code.

"I can’t read your map as a ward yet," he said after a breath. "But it’s not random. If your drawing repeats, we should look at the spaces where the old city systems meet. That might be where the old and the new keep arguing." 

"Is it dangerous?”

"Not yet," Bill said. “But if someone has been putting marks there repeatedly, someone is not trying to be decorative. We keep it in mind." 

Ginny swallowed. She had no wish to be frightened by this, and no wish to ignore it either.

Harry stood near the stairwell doorway and watched the two of them. He had just come out of the half-dark and was trying not to look as though he had already entered the old part of summer that was no longer safe.

Percy arrived with two cups of tea and one expression that was halfway between apology and correction.

"I know I was heavy this morning," he said as he set the cups down, "and I made a poor argument about lateness in a city built for weather. But if we are seeing patterns—" he nodded to Bill and Ginny "—we’ll track them properly. I’d rather be wrong and precise than right and late."

Ron set a cup near his hand and said, "You’re not wrong. You’re just British about certainty."

Percy looked as if he might argue. Then he rubbed his forehead and smiled at last. "I do this for a living," he said. "The world rewards certainty even when it’s mostly tidy pretending."

They all laughed, and for one bright moment the house sounded again like itself: too full of people to be quiet, too full of affection to be safe from risk.

Ginny waited until evening and then made a new page in the journal. She copied the symbol once more, this time with the corners sharper and the missing point filled by tiny, uncertain dots.

She wrote under it: **Could be a ward sequence. Could be utility. Could be a warning that only repeats where fog changes shape. Must check if seen at Coit again.**

When she finished, she realized she had written four pages of practical notes and two pages of symbols. Practical notes had arrows and class steps and notes about permits. The symbols had no instruction to follow.

Yet the day had not felt like instruction alone.

That night, the fog on the windows of the Haight House moved like a hand over old paper. Ginny shut the journal and looked at Harry through the open doorway.

"Did you get it right?" he asked.

"What thing?”

"That this place can be learned by smiling at it and still staying sharp." 

She nodded.

"And the weird mark?”

"Maybe a ward that wants us to look at the same place twice." 

Harry nodded back and held the word like a small weight. "I can live with that." 

Upstairs, Marisol’s note came in by a quiet boy from Fog Hollow with the only line she ever wrote to people in this family and did not mean to be mysterious: **A city with too many symbols has one that means danger. Go in daylight. Record everything.**

Ginny folded the note, tucked it into her journal over the symbol, and held the book to her chest as if it were a shield and a map at once.

Outside, the fog did not answer. It shifted. The same way fog always does, it moved one inch and then stopped, and in that stopped instant the street below seemed to draw a narrow line around itself.

Harry stood in the doorway and watched her close the book, then stepped inside without waiting to be asked.
For the first time since they had entered this country, Ginny and Harry both felt that line could be something more than weather.
