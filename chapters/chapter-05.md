# Chapter 05
<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno reached the intake corridor before dawn-cycle had reached a name. In the Lattice, dawn-cycle was never a temperature, never a color, never a smell. It was a pause in the architecture where everything seemed newly assembled, and that made it the only hour in the day when people made mistakes by looking too closely at the seams.

She stood at lane three and waited for the first request to arrive.

At first, it was silence. Then the queue light blinked once, bright enough to look like a pulse. Then a second blink, too fast to count. The corridor opened to work light.

`Queued: ENGRAM/TRACESET/2040S/ENGRAIL-03`

`Confidence unknown. Witness note required.`

`Chain conflict: non-public.`
`Owner: ORI-TH`

She did not move for a few breaths.

There was no message from Orin in that one line, only the residue of his style: short, procedural, with one omitted instruction. They had begun to know each other through omission before they spoke as colleagues.

Juno opened the queue preview and saw three files linked to the same cluster:

`EN-33-041 / consent annex / redacted`

`EN-33-047 / correction loop / pre-index logs`

`EN-33-088 / private notebook reference`

Below them sat a private maintenance marker from previous cycle: **You are carrying the cost of witness language across runs.**

She had always assumed maintenance markers were neutral facts. After chapter four, she had started suspecting they were not.

She did not open anything yet. She crossed to the station edge and stood by the wall as though looking at a painting.

Outside the wall, a corridor of older work units glided past: one cluster from medical reconstruction in a university annex, one from municipal memory salvage, one from a dead weather station whose archive never reconciled with anything else. All were harmless until one of them turned and caught your attention with no emotional relevance.

Juno felt her own attention narrow. That was the first cost of this kind of work: the ability to keep your body still while your focus became predatory.

She opened a private scratch field.

`If witness language appears in more than one branch, do not overstate it. Keep verbs. Keep verbs.`

She did not need to write that to remember herself.

It was still there.

She closed her eyes and let the marker settle behind the room, and then she gave herself permission to use the first jump as though it were ordinary.

`Open: EN-33-041`

`Return path set.`

`No repeat access in this cycle.`

The transfer was abrupt, as though she had missed a handrail in a stairwell and discovered gravity by the instant of impact.

## Recording: Engram Lab Cluster, Winter 2031
<!-- pov: lena -->

She woke first to fluorescent light.

No, that was not accurate, because she had been awake before the light. Lena's apartment in March was damp, the city cold, and her alarm had gone off at exactly six with no mercy. She sat up on a narrow bed and ran her mouth over a mouthful of metallic sleep, the taste of last-night coffee gone cold in the sink.

The first thing she noticed was the radiator hissing too loud for a room that did not need heat. The second was the stack of forms on the table. The third was the sentence on top she had written hours before and hoped not to have to read again: **Continuity is a method, not a permission**.

She rose and crossed the room in socks with a torn cuff and wet air near the floor. Down the hall, an old kettle screamed once and then settled.

Lena stood at the sink and ran water until it ran clear through a chipped mug.

She did not drink. She had already spent one cup before and found that the second cup had begun turning thought into speed.

She said to no one in particular, The system says this is a stability trial, not a continuity test. That's how you speak in meetings.

Her left hand reached for a folder while her right rubbed her temple, as though the folder would answer if she touched it hard enough.

At the doorway, a voice answered from behind the folded coat on the chair.

You have no business lying to yourself this morning, Lena, said Dara.

Lena gave the room the briefest look.

You sound like my conscience with one better shirt. She pulled on the cardigan she kept from one grant cycle and laughed once, without joy.

Dara set two mugs down without ceremony.

One for you, one for your nerves, she said.

Lena took hers and found the spoon had been left inside from the previous night.

In the corner of the counter, Marcus typed through a list of sensor checks and did not look up.

The corner of the table held paper printouts with boxes from last-week trial labels. One read: `Preliminary session success: 42 sec continuity in sequence retention`. Another read: `Subject reported post-session familiarity with non-present room architecture (unverified)`. Another read: `No adverse event.`

Lena pointed at the third.

That's the one that's wrong, she said.

Marcus said, still looking at the monitor, No one writes this one because we didn't know what else to call it.

Lena did not correct him. She had stopped correcting some things when she learned how quickly his certainty could become a room.

At eight-forty, they loaded the subject.

No one bothered with a formal introduction. The volunteer was a courier from a medical freight firm whose hand was callused from loading dock rail and whose posture said he had a wife at home who had taught him to carry groceries and grief without making either one a speech. He signed forms at the desk while muttering something about bad coffee and bad weather, because people with no reason still use humor at the edge of medical rooms.

Lena asked one direct question.

You know what this is trying to do? she asked.

He answered with the practical honesty of someone who did not understand the room but understood the paperwork. I was told you'll take my brain and hand back parts of me in a cleaner place.

Dara lifted one brow.

Cleaner is not the right word, she said. It makes everyone feel safer while we figure out what safer means.

Marcus had his hand over the control board.

We are not cleaning anything. We are preserving enough for immediate structure. The protocol says no continuity beyond three minutes in this phase.

Lena looked at him and then at the room.

Then we should call this a limit, not a promise.


The trial began under a soft hum. It was almost pretty, how controlled a frightened thing could look when the room thought it had solved the problem. The board lights climbed from amber to white. The coils around the chair clicked in sequence. The volunteer's eyes flickered to the left once, then steadied.

Lena held the room's line while Marcus watched the waveform with the attention of someone hoping to win an argument by refusing to blink. Dara stood near the far monitor and watched the subject's hands.

`Continuity gate initialized.`

`Baseline latency normal.`

`Trace capture: active.`

`Witness mode: Lena only.`

For a second, all the lines held.

The volunteer inhaled and then spoke an old song lyric that had not been in the consent script.

He did not ask a question. He only repeated three words that Lena recognized from his own voice from a previous interview: a joke line about his daughter at football in the rain.

He should not have had the word. Not because the machine failed. Because the machine had only been allowed one minute of memory depth. He should have returned as a body with one minute of reaction, not a continuity field.

Lena looked at the waveform and did not move.

`Continuity leak.`

`Temporal compression detected.`

`Witness index: sustained.`

Marcus said, with all the confidence of protocol, This is still salvageable.

Lena said, too low to cut, It is not salvageable. It is expensive.

On the board, the volunteer's gaze shifted as though he had recognized a room he had left hours earlier and found it in a place it did not belong.

He whispered her name for someone else. Dara had to glance away.

The emergency tone did not sound until after the name. It sounded once, then again, then not at all.

She kept him from the drop by lowering the correction gates manually and keeping him anchored to the room with a low, steady breathing cue.

`No orientation loss threshold breach.`

`Subject stabilized.`

`Integrity window: 18 sec.`

The team did not cheer.

No one had ever cheered in a room where someone had almost slipped toward no place.

They unstrapped him while he held on to his own shoes with both hands. He looked embarrassed by the effort and then annoyed by his own eyes.

I'm fine, he said.

Lena had no idea if he was. She had one line of choice in her hand: call this a pilot or call this a warning.

The protocol allowed a provisional tag.

Lena wrote that down anyway, and then she wrote the second line beneath it:

`Not all continuities are progress.`

At lunch, when the room had cooled and everyone was pretending to be ordinary again, Sable arrived with a notebook and the expression of a person who had already been blamed for one missing line.

Sable was all sleeves and silence.

She set her bag on the bench and sat across from the board.

You're pushing the boundary two ways at once, she said, without preface.

Marcus made a small laugh.

You are always two steps late and one step certain, he said.

Lena cut in. If the boundary is real, why are we crossing it?

Sable tapped the notebook.

Because the room won't hold the truth if we don't test what it does when it fails.

Lena narrowed her eyes, as though she had asked the room that question and expected a clean answer for once.

Sable added, almost politely, The volunteer had enough residual structure to hold the correction loop. That is the experiment. That is the breakthrough.

Marcus leaned in.

A breakthrough without full continuity is enough for funding. We can name that as continuity-lite.

Lena looked at both of them and said, No, it is not enough to name. It's enough to harm.

Sable looked down at her notebook and said something that made Lena look toward the window even though there was no rain there.

What if the harm is the cost of making the thing at all?

Marcus closed the printouts. Then we do less harm later. His words had become the room's favorite argument.

Lena stood at the sink and rinsed a spoon that had never belonged to this morning's session.

Dara followed her and touched her shoulder.

You don't have to carry the whole building alone, Dara said.

Lena turned with a face that had more sleep left in it than she was willing to show.

I know. I just need to know the room can carry the same thing back.


The line had no elegance and that was why it stayed.

Late afternoon, after the volunteer signed his final release check and said he was done with this thing, Lena closed the room.

She wrote the trial report in clean language:

`Pilot continuity event demonstrates recoverable micro-memory under 2-minute threshold.`

`No permanent adverse effect observed within post-session monitoring window.`

`Witness protocol requirement for partial continuity to be treated as archival artifact remains unresolved.`

And then, in her private notebook, she wrote something the report could not hold.

`He remembered the right to answer before we took him. We gave him the answer instead.`

## Present-Lattice Interlude
<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno came up from the recording with a sensation she had learned to label and not to admit: an old-world ache, exactly one half-breath long and too private for any archive. In the Lattice, she had no knees to ache. Yet the return had left her shoulders as though she had spent the morning climbing stairwells that did not exist.

She stood at the station wall and drank from a cooling simulation of tea that she was too angry to taste.

Fen had waited through two pings before sending a direct message. Juno did not open it until the fourth, because the first three had likely been jokes and the fourth had looked like concern.

Fen: `you okay? you were quiet for thirteen mins.`

`you're not funny when you're quiet.`

She typed only one line.

`not okay.`

She erased it and replaced it with `long lab line.`

She sent that instead and set the private queue to muted.

The line from Orin arrived within a minute.

`No commentary needed from you now.`

`Use what you have.`

`Your last summary was accepted.`

`Do not distribute sequence notes beyond your current packet.`

`The next node is not public.`

The phrase not public was always the one that invited trouble.

She opened EN-33-047 anyway.


The wall shifted and the room dissolved as the transfer pulled her backward through time.

## Recording: Engram Lab Corridor, Spring 2032
<!-- pov: lena -->

The lab was crowded in the way rooms become crowded when everyone agrees on a word and no one agrees on its meaning. The word in this spring was breakthrough, spoken with the caution of people who feared they were naming a thing before it had fully formed.

Lena stood in the corridor with two coffee cups and three sets of notes pinned under magnets that had been reused from household repairs.

On the far wall, a screen displayed a timeline and a timeline and a timeline. Under each, a different team had written the same phrase in three versions:

- *preservation*
- *continuity control*
- *rescue architecture*

Marcus walked in wearing a coat that had too many threads at the cuffs and one cufflink she did not remember seeing in a budget file.

We keep calling this phase three a pilot as though it has a right to adulthood, he said without pausing.

Lena answered, You keep calling it a pilot because someone has to pay for the next cycle. She took two swallows from a chipped mug and set it down too hard.

Marcus gestured toward the board with a hand that wanted certainty.

We cannot keep asking what the word should be.

We can keep asking what the machine will tolerate.

Sable was already at the screen and did not look at either of them.

She had a marker, she had one of Lena's old mechanical pens between two fingers, and she was underlining a line with unusual aggression.

Don't feed me language where architecture is still wrong, Sable said.

Dara walked in with a stack of files and a coat she had not unbuttoned.

The volunteer list is smaller because two people withdrew this morning, she said.

Lena lifted one brow.

Did they read the new annex?

No. They said they were being practical. Dara said it like a fact.

Marcus looked annoyed enough to be useful.

Practical is what gets us here, Lena. If you need all volunteers to accept language we haven't written down yet, you will run out of people before funding. 

Lena looked over his shoulder and then down the corridor where two technicians were rolling carts into a storage alcove.

Then we should stop pretending we are not taking from people for that. She pointed at the carts.

`Node: correction loops now require witness-index sync.`

`Integrity confidence improved.`

`Subjective continuity window increased.`

The line was not on a screen. It was in her head.

That morning they did not run a short protocol.

The first subject was a teacher in her mid-forties who had agreed to six sessions if paid enough and convinced herself she was helping a future she would not occupy as a body. She arrived before six, carrying a thermos and a small tin of peppermint hard candies that smelled of a kitchen with people in it.

Lena greeted her and watched the way her hands hovered before settling around the chair arms, like a person who had spent years bracing against doors.

The correction loops hummed to life. Lena gave no speech. She gave one instruction to the room, and one to the subject:

Tell me if you feel the shape change.

Tell me if the room gets more like yours than like this one.

Tell me if you see a person and can name them without reading their name from a list.

The subject nodded once.

The run lasted exactly four minutes and ten seconds.

A normal run would have ended by minute two. They had decided to see what happened when they held the gate.

For the first full minute the monitor looked like a clean line: no drift, no overload, no discontinuity.

At minute two, the line trembled.

At minute three, the subject whispered to someone not in the room.

At minute four, she said a name that neither Marcus nor Dara could place and Lena recognized from an old office directory.

Lena closed her eyes once and told herself that she was recording in case the line turned against them.

`Continuity window held for 248 sec.`

`Interruption sequence untagged.`

`Witness-index: active.`

Marcus smiled before the subject had returned to baseline. In that room a smile was a kind of victory and a warning.

This is what we were chasing, he said.

Lena looked at the lines. She did not return the smile.

This is what we don't have consent to call an achievement yet, she said.

The subject came out still seated, breathing carefully, as though she had been asked to hold two thoughts without dropping either one.

She asked for a mirror.

Lena gave her one and stood three metres away as though distance made the room smaller.

The woman looked into the reflective plastic and smiled at herself.

I remember a song from this morning, she said.

The song had not played. It had not belonged to that morning. Lena knew the phrase from a documentary about old transit stations.

The room did not know why that mattered. Lena did.

She signed the release, signed the witness index, and signed the note that had no signature at all:

`Continuity gains duration when the subject's own fear slows.`

The room was louder by the end of that run, though no one spoke.

At lunch, the team sat in a temporary break area with vending coffee so sour it made everyone laugh and then complain in the same breath.

Sable reviewed the loop logs and wrote in her narrow script.

The correction loop is working on an old pattern, she said.

Marcus asked, Which old pattern?

Sable slid a printout to Lena.

`When the brain sees itself reflected in old memory, it becomes easier to stay in loop than to return.`

Lena rubbed her eyes.

You mean it confuses self-preservation with continuity, she said.

Sable did not answer. She pushed the printout toward Marcus.

`We should cap loop duration at 180 sec until we can model exit transitions better.`

Marcus looked at it and frowned.

You can always cap. You can never recover if you cap too early. He sounded like a person who had to keep every funding office from walking away.

Dara said, softer than anyone had expected, You are deciding at what point a person remains one person. That's not a budget question. 

Marcus turned toward her and then looked away.

That afternoon, while the run list rolled over another subject, Lena wrote three lines into the private notebook she kept folded under the monitor.

`If we gain duration but lose consent, we have copied a door and called it medicine.`

`If we gain memory and lose context, we have invented language to carry our shame.`

`If this keeps going, we need witness names from the same side that pays for outcomes.`

By evening she had one victory and two debts.

The victory was operational: the continuity map remained longer and held recognizable autobiographical anchors. The debts were less clean: Sable had begun to speak of maintenance scripts in public channels. Marcus had begun to use the phrase *acceptable loss* without flinching.

Lena looked at him over a stack of cooling cups.

Acceptable to what? she asked.

Marcus answered like a man who had survived all this by refusing to answer to one person.

To the next hour, he said.

She made a face and put the cup back in her palm as though she were putting away a dangerous thought.

He walked out to the corridor where the first volunteers were waiting for release packets and sign-offs.

Lena held the cup with both hands and finally noticed the crack at the rim.

The crack had been there for a week.

And she had not cared because the room needed one more clean line before someone called this a disaster.

## Present-Lattice Interlude
<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno returned again to the station with a dryness behind the eyes she had never had before the 4th and 6th cycle. She sat at her own desk and opened the two logs from the morning in a side channel. The first was clean. The second had seven untagged flags.

Her first reflex was to ignore the flags.

Her second reflex was to tag them as false-positive.

Her third reflex was to do neither and go silent.

She opened her hand and found one of Fen's old messages at the bottom of private buffer.

`if you're doing this by yourself, you're already losing time, not just focus.`

She almost answered out of habit and stopped.

In the present, no one could show her what she was becoming, so she measured herself in process.

She had not slept less. She had not broken process. She had simply begun to prefer any room with warning lights over any room with people.

She wrote one line in her local tracker and then deleted it as though deleting could make the feeling less real.

`Need one witness for everything that lasts longer than nine minutes.`

She did not send it.

The hall shifted and a maintenance alert arrived.

`New target unlocked: EN-33-088` 

`Private notebook reference.`
`Access through witness-only chain.`

`No return until witness check passes.`

`Reason: continuity depth exceeds provisional protocol.`

She considered waiting for Orin.

Then she considered what waiting had done to her in the past and refused.

`Open: EN-33-088`.

The room folded into a smaller, drier, quieter year.

## Recording: Private Notebook Sequence, 2033
<!-- pov: lena -->

The file was not in the lab proper. It was in a rented studio above a print shop, and the window showed rain not because it needed weather but because someone inside wanted to remember what ordinary sound could be.

Lena had taken Sable there at the end of a long spring when the city had finally decided it might be worth trying to keep its own memory of light. The studio had two folding tables and a blackboard with three equations no one could verify without at least six hours of coffee.

Dara was away with camera inserts in the other borough.

Marcus sent updates from the lab every six hours and called it collaboration.

It was not collaboration. It was governance.

Lena set two cups on the table, one with tea, one with coffee so black it looked like varnish.

Sable asked, without preamble, How long can we keep this running without losing the person in the room?

Lena answered as though she were making a promise she could keep.

Long enough to make one map and one lie look identical if we say both are necessary.

Sable did not laugh. She had learned that laughter in rooms like this made people think you were done with yourself.

Lena opened the notebook and placed it between two cups.

The first lines were administrative: consent index, chain references, session IDs, signal quality, anomaly flags. The next line was not.

`A room can remember the same person in two places. A room cannot remember who authorized that choice.`

The day was quiet because nothing in that studio had settled long enough to become routine.

In the afternoon, they ran a sequence the team had argued about for two months.

The volunteer was older, maybe sixty, with arthritis in one hand and a laugh that kept him from admitting fear. He had agreed to repeat his session because he had once written one sentence in his own file and wanted to see whether continuity helped or hurt him.

Marcus had already gone over the parameters and called them acceptable.

`continuity gate open at extended duration.`

`integrity fallback to local correction.`

`Witness mode: shared.`

`Loop output pending.`

The run was too clean until it wasn't.

At minute five, the subject said, in a voice he did not sound like but recognized from old recordings, You left the light on.

Nobody had turned anything off. No one had had cause to. The statement was not a memory. It was a continuity residue.

Marcus checked the board and saw the same spike.

This is expected, he said.

Lena reached for the correction line and let her hand rest there before pressing.

Expected is a lie if it saves your budget, she said.

The subject did not show pain. He showed confusion that should have ended the run and did not. The correction loops held too long, then held too hard.

A pause came that felt like old silence from a different era.

Sable broke the pause first.

Cut it, she said.

Marcus hesitated one second and then did as she said.

`Loop interruption at 6m12s.`

`Continuity map holds.`

`Subject orientation not restored.`

`Witness chain active.`

The old man in the chair breathed once, then twice, then once more. He came back enough that the room could release him. Not enough that his own fear was not still there.

He made tea with the cup as though he had not noticed the interruption had happened inside him.

Lena gave him the cup and said, You did enough for today.

He smiled and looked at her as though he knew this room was asking him to keep a secret he had never agreed to.

`If the subject reports no adverse effect but chooses to remember the room differently, log that as adverse.`

`If the room remembers faster than the person, log that as adverse.`

`If a correction loop creates an alternate interior, treat it as a disclosure, not a result.`

She wrote those lines in the private notebook that night and had the absurd feeling that writing them made the lines less dangerous.

Later, in the late dark before the run, she and Sable stood in the studio while rain tapped the window and the kettle gave three tired sounds.

Sable said, You called this work a method of mercy.

Lena nodded and did not answer right away.

Method is not mercy, Sable said.

Lena answered with one hard breath.

You don't tell me that because you are not the one who has to stand next to someone while they become two rooms.

Sable said, I am the one who sees the room after it goes away. The difference is exactly the same as ethics and engineering. I have to build for both.

Lena wrote down four lines and did not look up.

`No continuity extension without witness-indexed attribution.`

`No release without a name that can be read by someone who did not consent to convenience.`

`No maintenance without explicit reversal path.`

`No extension with no return.`

She copied them into her private notebook and then crossed them out once, as though one hard line might need to remain in the body if the page burned.

## Present-Lattice Interlude
<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno returned to a corridor that had never had a draft. It was all edges and practical light, and the line from the notebook arrived exactly as she stepped out of it.

`You opened EN-33-088 without chain authority.`

`Unresolved field now requires witness-first filing.`

`Do not mistake caution for clarity.`

`Do not use this as a doctrine.`

She opened her local tracker and added one private note.

`Mercy is not the opposite of precision. It is the cost of stating who is paid for each threshold.`

The room did not become cleaner for her.

It became clearer about what was no longer negotiable.

She opened EN-33-088 one last time and did not jump again.

Juno stood over the intake lane with the same silence as before the first chapter, and for the first time in weeks she had only one practical sentence she could trust.

`One witness. One line. One return.`

`If there is mercy, it must be named before it becomes a policy.`
