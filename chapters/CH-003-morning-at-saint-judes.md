## Hook

The station clock struck ten minutes past nine before the fog fully lifted from the lane, and the morning had that peculiar city-bright look which belongs neither to dawn nor daybreak, but to weather deciding, at last, to let you see what it has already done.

On the road to Saint Jude’s Infirmary, the tram rails held the wet like cold glass. Vale stood a step ahead of the cart at the curb, breathing in short puffs, watching the water bead off the curb stones where his boots touched only hard places. A man who worked by tide, by mud, and by lamp-light did not trust a straight line in rain. He preferred marks: where rope had dragged, where wheel had slipped, where a key had passed through metal.

The infirmary rose at the top of the ward hill, all soot-dark brick and shuttered windows, each slit reflecting the same uncertain light. Behind one side door a bell had struck once—deep, unhurried, the second and third intervals swallowed by the weather as if someone had held the bell’s tongue in cloth.

“Still doing their bells wrong,” said Sergeant Thomas Vale beneath his breath.

His note about bells was not an opinion. It was an instruction.

At the side entrance stood a narrow-eyed porter with a ledger under his arm and the cautious face of a man who had learned that every witness is partly right and partly frightened.

“Inspector?” Vale asked.

She did not come because he shouted. She came by looking toward the rain, as if to count how it moved.

“Inspector Pencombe is two streets away,” he replied. “I told her this was no station call. She said to keep the records room clear.”

The porter nodded, half relieved, half alarmed by being asked to believe an absence. He opened the metal gate with one wrist and held it as if he had not wanted to make that choice before sunrise.

Inside, the air had the smell of wet wool, carbolic, and stale bread. It was a smell that suggested order and panic had both tried to stay but neither had won.

Vale did not let him ask first what he expected to find. He asked what was wrong.

"Stock in room three is short by one full barrel," the porter said. “Not from the official line. From ward tally. And from two people I can’t both blame.”

At that, Vale felt the case shift. The body at Hallowford had been a locked-room lesson. This was a locked-room manual.

## Scene 1 — Saint Jude’s Front Doors

The first rule at Saint Jude’s, if it still existed, was that no one walked through the supply corridor without a key chain and a stamped wrist seal.

The second rule, if everyone followed it, was that no one kept one.

Vale started with that contradiction.

He let his hat brush the corridor rail and climbed to the service stair that smelled of limewash and old coal. The stair had damp under the balustrade and two narrow marks near the landing where somebody had passed with a metal bar not too recently to be old, too recently to be fresh.

Above him, a nurse in an ink-blue apron opened and closed a side door that held a blue chalk tag.

“Morning,” she said. Not greeting, no warmth.

“Good,” Vale said. “Good for you. Is this your side staircase?”

She gave him the look of someone who had been asked to explain weather.

“It belongs to records. If you need the records room, speak with Mr. Hargreaves at the desk.”

Vale nodded at her tag. It was the official stamp color: cobalt, with a small raised line that matched other hospital seals.

“Do you pass it to more than one room?” he asked.

She hesitated and did not answer. Instead, she moved her right wrist into the strip of light from the stair window and showed a half-moon of black ink under the skin: a circular stamp impression, smudged at one edge.

“Not yours?” Vale asked.

“It is mine,” she said. “Last night shift. I put that on a requisition from the medicine room at ten past ten.”

“Why?” he asked.

“Doctor Hale requested a restricted compound.”

Vale looked at the stamp and then at her unforced eyes.

“Doctor Hale or someone who uses his line?” he said.

She swallowed. “The form said `M-B` and a C-mark. Same as the one you already have from station.”

He repeated the letters quietly. “M-B.” The same line had broken through from the station this morning. Same suffix. Same ink confusion.

He moved up the landing and into the records corridor. Metal cupboards at the wall had thin channels where brass had rubbed. Dust had not settled evenly there; one cabinet had a faint crescent of recent abrasion where a ring had been turned too quickly.

The corridor clock marked 9:37 by habit, but the minute hand hesitated every few cycles when damp got into its teeth. He made a note anyway.

The infirmary corridor, where voices usually moved like water through pipes, had a stillness to it this morning that made the station bells sound far away.

At the end of the corridor stood two doors: Access Room and Night-Ward Registry.

An auxiliary key sat in a glass box near Access Room. The key’s teeth were not new. Someone had used it with pressure, then wiped it with a cloth so thin you could almost call it an attempt.

Vale touched the key with his thumb and wrote one line in his own notebook before asking the question out loud:

“How many seals were used to open that cabinet after midnight?”

No one answered directly. The station porter looked toward the corridor floor and said, "You can ask Dr. Hale’s wife by next shift, maybe, but in this building every woman in silk has a husband with a key and every man in wool has a clerk for a conscience." It was the sort of sentence meant to say nothing and everything.

Vale did not follow it.

He checked the lockplate. There was a damp trace near the keyhole, faint but present. Not the same ring as Hallowford’s seal paste, not as thick, but shaped as if pressed with a fingertip rather than a finger. It was not an accident.

He had seen such paste after freight delays and after rushed house moves. It did not mean malice. It meant hurry with a method.

Down in the hall, a bell rang twice—station and infirmary at once—then one late in sequence, all at once out of sync. Someone in the tower likely had a hand on the signal wheel and a reason to keep it off by minute.

Vale paused and listened.

A bell can lie, but not in this order. A delay in sound is still a delay in time, and everyone who keeps ledgers learns to trust the delay.

He moved on.

## Scene 2 — Witness Block at the Nurse Station

Inspector Pencombe arrived on foot five minutes later in a dark coat too new to belong to rain and too practical to belong to fashion. She removed the rain from her cuffs and looked at the station clerk as if he were a puzzle with the answer already printed in his mouth.

“Thank you for making the room usable,” she said.

He looked embarrassed. “We are only doing what we can, Inspector. We can do more if we are lucky.”

The corridor smelled stronger now as the infirmary kitchen opened a vent nearby. Someone had boiled tea in a hurry and overdone the sugar. Vale stood there beside the registry desk and watched her work without words.

Pencombe did not waste first minutes on blame. She opened a page from her notebook and asked each witness where they had been in the last three hours before midnight.

The nurse on the station stool did not rise. She had a face already made of lines and a chin that did not allow her to lie quickly.

“Name,” Pencombe began.

“Nurse Beatrice,” she said.

“Your initials are only on one register line.”

“I was asked not to sign. Doctor’s request, I think.”

“Who asked?”

“Not doctor. A night porter. He said his line was short. Said it was a correction for sedation for the private ward.”

Pencombe noted the word *short* and looked up at the ward clock. The clock showed a minute ahead of the station clock by seven. Another delay. Another thread.

“How many restricted compounds did you authorise?”

“Two records and one tally.”

“Show me both.”

Beatrice placed two books on the desk. One was the formal requisition ledger with printed columns and clean script. The other was a smaller tally page, copied by hand, with a pencilled barrel count and one crossed-out line.

Vale leaned forward and read the numbers.

“Official: four compounds in the protected stock for night care.”

“Unofficial tally: three entries, and one correction.”

“Difference?” Pencombe asked.

“Four and three plus one crossed line,” Beatrice said, with the fatal precision of someone who has had to be accurate while exhausted. “One entry added as `M-B / 2 / C` and one barrel moved to private transfer at twenty-three twenty-seven.”

“Was that signed?” Pencombe asked.

Beatrice looked almost relieved.

“No signature.”

“Who made the transfer?”

"That’s what makes me sorry,” the nurse said, and her fingers tightened around the edge of the tally book. “I did not make the transfer. I logged what I saw. I still see little of what people want me to see.”

Pencombe held the page carefully. The correction line had a short stroke where the clerk had scraped a word and replaced it with a symbol. She recognized that symbol from the Hallowford note: a C. Not clean, but familiar.

“Someone logged a compound under incomplete signature,” Vale said.

Pencombe nodded, and her voice dropped. “Or someone used an authority the station has not yet recorded.”

The next witness was a younger dresser from the surgery side, breathless and unwilling to meet eye contact.

“Did you request anything tonight?” Pencombe asked.

He shook his head.

“Did anyone claim that they did?”

The boy swallowed and pointed toward a narrow counter.

“Myself, maybe. Clerk at records showed a requisition for a late stock check but no packet. We signed off the count in the corridor, and then there was rain at the back windows.”

“Name,” Pencombe asked.

“Daniel.”

He did not offer his surname. He did not need to.

Vale wrote under the same heading as Hallowford, the one with the bell and the keyhole paste, and then asked for the ward keys.

“Give me every key chain in the medicines corridor,” Pencombe said. “Not just the active one. The retired keys too.”

The clerk returned with a tray of brass. Some keys had been recently polished; one was matte and carried a shallow mark at the shoulder.

“Who uses this?” Pencombe asked.

“Retired ring,” said the porter. “Not in use since the fire case, before winter.”

“Still in use,” Vale murmured.

A second bell rang in the corridor from the tram route outside. Pencombe looked up from the tray of keys and checked the wall clock: 9:54, exactly the wrong minute for either staff movement or formal lunch.

“Who signed the night shift roster?” she asked.

Silence.

Then one of the clerks cleared his throat.

“The night shift roster was transcribed at dawn,” he said. “The printed one has only four names. The working copy has six.”

“Which two are ghost hands?” Vale asked.

The porter looked down, then at Beatrice. He did not answer.

Beatrice said, quietly, “One from Saint Jude’s proper, one from the records side.”

“Ghost names?” Pencombe said. “Or copied names?”

The porter finally put his face into the light.

“Maybe both, Inspector.”

Pencombe let the line sit. “Both are difficult, and neither helps us unless we pin down which name had access to restricted compounds.”

The nurse station was a room designed to keep sorrow behind numbers, but every number in it looked like a door now.

He let them breathe. Let silence become an interview method.

A woman at the back, older than Beatrice and with hands that had done all the lifting no one else saw, said softly:

“If you are asking who requested `M-B` in private, the answer is easier: someone with a wrist seal not yours.”

“Whose?” Pencombe asked.

“Dusk nurse, not shift,” said the old woman. “She doesn’t come for ward work.”

That one sentence changed the room.

Pencombe did not show triumph. She showed interest.

“Describe the seal,” she said.

“Same shape as our official round stamp,” said the old woman. “But the edge was blurred like it had dried quick. She pressed it on a sheet no bigger than a hand, then went out through medicine room back stairs.”

“Did you identify this person?”

“Not cleanly.”

“Name?”

“No. She kept her collar up.”

A red line appeared on Pencombe’s tongue before she spoke it: red herring. Everyone at night shift had a reason to be wrong. A missing log can be arithmetic, a missing signature can be fatigue, a blurred seal can be damp ink.

Vale watched the room. No one contradicted the old woman. No one did. In this room, agreement means either guilt or fear.

“Thank you, nurse. Keep your eyes on corridor one and return all books to secure custody.”

“Are we to detain anyone?” Beatrice asked.

Pencombe did not take her eyes away from the books.

“Not yet. For now, we map.”

## Scene 3 — The Ledger Room Confrontation

The records room had two clocks and one stove, and everyone who entered expected one of each to answer for the other. Pencombe did not wait for someone to show her a chair. She held one of the key books upright and asked for the morning roster.

“By name, then by hour,” she said.

Clerk Hargreaves arrived with the shift sheets and a face that looked as if every line had to pay rent.

He opened the folder on the table and spread two papers: the official register and a torn roster page with smudges at two lines. A third column had been corrected and initialed in a script too small for ordinary record work.

“Doctor’s private line?” Pencombe asked.

Hargreaves did not answer at first.

“He may have signed one requisition, yes,” he said. “He had no need for night access beyond one case.”

“Not for private compounds.”

She waited, then asked in the tone Vale knew best for turning people into facts.

“Who else had secondary custody access to M-B stocks this week?”

Hargreaves hesitated and then handed her a duplicate sheet.

“What I have here,” he said, “is a copy from storage and is incomplete.”

“Good,” said Pencombe, not because incompleteness helps, but because it confirms a line of pressure.

They began at 21:00 and ran back to 23:30. Pencombe watched the handwriting, not the text, and found two habits. A sloped loop in the twelfth line of the roster was someone used to writing medicine names. The correction mark near the same line had a square stroke: practical, not elegant.

“The `M-B 2 C` mark,” said Pencombe, tapping the margin, “appears here at 23:07 by an unlisted signature. That is not a clerical slip. That is an access event.”

“Could be arithmetic correction,” Hargreaves said quickly.

“Could,” Vale said. “Could is the first thing everyone says before there is a witness with a timeline.”

Pencombe did not contradict.

She asked for a wrist-seal sample list from night staff.

Hargreaves brought an envelope with old seal impressions—brown circles with date and initials. Pencombe compared the newest set and found one not yet copied onto the official page.

She picked it up, turned to light, and frowned.

“See this line,” she said. “The seal edge has a faint double impression. The same shape appears on this copied register as `W-5`. Same shift and same night window.”

“W-5 is not a formal worker,” Hargreaves said.

“Exactly.”

She held up another piece.

“Where did this come from?” she asked.

“From the medicine cabinet wrist plate,” he said. “Someone pressed the same seal through wet cloth and then used a pencil mark to reroute tally.”

Vale said, very softly, “Duplicate path.”

Pencombe turned to the roster. The printed signatures for 21:00, 22:00, and 22:30 had one name repeated with a shifted loop, while a second worker’s initials had been inserted in pencil without the proper authority line.

“Was anyone disciplined for missing this?” Vale asked.

“No,” said Hargreaves. “It passed internal review for this week.”

“Someone ensured it passed,” Pencombe said. “That means we are looking at either error spread across tired staff—or intentional channeling through the duplicate pathway.”

“Could someone from the warehouse pass in with a temporary authority?” he asked.

“Only if someone else made the paperwork to allow it,” Pencombe said.

Then she asked the key question the ledger demanded:

“Who held a key imprint key at this hour?”

Hargreaves frowned and turned to the sidebook he had hidden behind the paperweight.

“Imprint key?”

“She is in your custody,” said Vale, pointing.

Hargreaves produced a print card with a set of teeth in pencil, then another matching card in blue wax near the edge.

“It was never filed,” he admitted. “Because it was used in a test and then returned.”

“Who authorised the test?” Pencombe asked.

He looked toward Vale and then back at the paper.

“Not in my log,” he said. “No one with a standard signature.”

This was the first explicit crack.

“No witness can testify to a test without a signature,” Pencombe said, and when the room moved in small panic she held his gaze.

“Was there a storm-order on the night?” Vale asked.

Hargreaves nodded toward the window.

“After twenty-two, the fog got dense along the corridor. They told us not to reopen the side stair for non-urgent transfers.”

“Yet it was reopened,” said Pencombe. “Whether by force or procedure is now a forensic question.”

She stood, not angry but deliberate.

“Give me every entry with `M-B` and every log where stamp was added after midnight. Then give me any page where someone has signed with anything less than the full clerk signature. We are looking for a second hand on a first-author line.”

“We are, Inspector,” said Vale, and he stepped to the door.

“I know,” said Hargreaves, and there was relief in that word, not innocence.

## Scene 4 — The Refusal

If Saint Jude’s were a house, this was the room where secrets choose furniture.

Pencombe left the records room for the staff corridor and asked to see the person who had signed, in pencil, for the post-storm access check. He came late and wore gloves so fresh he had not worked them into this corridor yet.

His shoulders made all the right kinds of silence. Men who hide behind duty do not look for the door; they learn where it ends.

“Your name,” Pencombe said.

The man said, “I am no named witness,” and stood with the exact posture of someone rehearsing refusal.

“Then choose one,” said Pencombe.

“None of this concerns me,” he replied.

“Everyone in this corridor concerns this case,” said Vale.

Pencombe said nothing, which meant the room would now hold no more courtesy.

“Mr. Hargreaves says you signed for M-B access at twenty-three twenty-seven,” Vale added.

“He did not. That was a correction.”

“Corrected where?” asked Pencombe.

He gave the smallest shrug. “I told him the line was wrong.”

“Who told you it was wrong?”

Silence.

Pencombe looked at his left hand. The nails were clean. The cuffs were clean. Too clean.

“Do you work with the side route to the medicine room?” she asked.

He nodded once, then closed his mouth.

“Not from this shift,” he said.

“Not from this shift,” Pencombe repeated. “Then from which?”

“Night ward relief.”

“Who authorised that relief?”

He seemed to be waiting for someone else to ask him first. No one did.

“Do you know why the station’s delay marker and the hospital line do not agree with your signature?” she asked.

“That’s weather,” he said.

“Weather does not erase a seal stamp,” Vale said.

The man’s jaw tightened.

“Listen to me,” Pencombe said calmly. “The body at Hallowford did not call for another man with a stamp and unfiled copy. It called for trust. If trust was stolen, this is where it left the building.”

He did not flinch. “I am not a culprit,” he said.

“I did not call you one,” she answered. “I called you accountable.”

He laughed once without mirth. “You know what you want.”

“What I want,” she said, “is what everyone in this room has had for a week: a sequence where one missing name can no longer hide under fog.”

He opened his mouth, then shut it with the caution of men who have family in service houses.

At that point Pencombe changed tack.

“Then help us with this: was a duplicate wrist seal used by anyone outside the authorised list?”

He looked directly at her for the first time. There was fear there, but also a kind of weary agreement.

“Someone passed with a private ring,” he said. “You won’t get me a list from me, Inspector.”

“What do you think this person was trying to do?” asked Vale.

“Keep one packet moving,” the man said. “Not steal, not steal outright. Keep it moving while someone else held a line.”

Pencombe wrote down every word, then asked the simplest question: “Who asked them?”

He turned to the wall and stood there as if the wall had the answer. “A legal man does that when he needs time, not speed.”

“Name.”

He finally spoke it once, quietly.

“Gideon.”

The name landed in the room like a dropped key.

Vale did not move. Pencombe stood still too. A full minute passed and if any witness can call that a confession it is because they cannot hear what is not said.

“Did he ask directly?” Pencombe asked.

“It was never a direct request,” said the man. “It was a correction to procedure. A correction, done with a legal urgency.”

Pencombe looked up and then turned to Vale.

“Tell Inspector Hargreaves we may have motive in administration, not only access.”

The ward clock struck once, then stopped on the damp minute before going on again.

Pencombe asked one last question.

“Who else handled the ring?”

He shook his head.

“Did you bring the package?”

“Someone else did.”

“Who?”

He gave the same answer all reluctant witnesses eventually give.

“I can’t.”

Pencombe did not force him. She removed her cap and set it on the records chair.

“Then you can still tell us this much: whether that someone had family proximity.”

He hesitated long enough for the station bell to ring from the outer office.

“Maybe,” he said. “Close enough to be trusted. Not close enough to be loved.”

He walked away then, and the corridor swallowed him.

Vale stood by the desk and ran his fingers over the wax-sealed page where the missing signature sat. His face was harder than his tone.

“Your red herring is arithmetic,” Pencombe said, watching Hargreaves, Beatrice, and the remaining staff from the hall glass. “And a frightened intern would be easier than this. But we no longer have arithmetic.”

She turned to him and nodded toward the corridor where the first bell had failed and then returned.

“We are not hunting one tired man,” she said. “We are tracing a managed path. We have two clues that matter: a secondary access route and a missing chain between request and custody. That means this is not opportunistic.”

“Infrastructure plus motive,” Vale said.

“Exactly,” said Pencombe. “Institutional access, institutional silence.”

She gathered the key ring, the ledger copies, and the seal impression list and moved to the door.

“No arrests yet,” she said. “No headlines, not until we can tie this packet to a room and a time. But from this floor onward we stop treating Saint Jude’s as a building and begin treating it as a map. Someone moved through one key route and one medicine route at the same hour. The city may only see a nurse with bad arithmetic; we must find the person who made that arithmetic usable.”

Outside, the rain had shifted to sleet and the morning looked less like day than a held breath.

The station cart waited. Pencombe paused in the lane, set one hand on the doorframe, and read the names she had written once more: W-5, `M-B`, duplicate seal, post-storm access.

The city had offered her one more day of fog. That was all. Enough.

Not enough, not yet.

## Clues & Revelations

- **C-006** — The official records and ward tally for protected compounds diverge: one official entry records four barrel units, while a secondary tally and witness accounts indicate one missing and one rerouted unit.
- **C-007** — A duplicate wrist-seal impression appears in the ledger room and matches an unlisted access event close to the 23:07 window linked to post-storm movement.
- **C-008** — An unlisted and possibly forged or omitted requisition entry (`M-B 2 C`) exists near the medicine row and lacks proper signature and custody annotation.
- **Institutional access breach identified** — Pencombe and Vale begin shifting from a single-scene locked-room frame to a chain model involving secondary custody and access duplication at Saint Jude’s.
- **Key emotional turn** — Inspector Pencombe’s posture moves from grief-led urgency to controlled operational strategy; staff cohesion breaks under corroborated timeline and key-trace pressure.

## Continuity Notes

- Scene sequence aligns with `DOC-004` Chapter 03: clinic arrival, nursing witness block, ledger-room signature comparison against roster, final resistance/denial that opens a suspect corridor.
- Time anchors follow `DOC-006`: this chapter remains within the Morning-to-midday window before `CH-04`, with explicit references to clock, bell, and tram timing.
- Motifs in `DOC-007` remain active: fog, bells, keys/seals, ledgers, and institutional paperwork as both burden and method.
- No new named recurring character introduced. All named figures remain within current character bibles (`DOC-002`) and approved planning artifacts.
- The `M-B 2 C` notation and missing signature chain create continuity pressure on `DOC-005` for systemic suppression inference (to be resolved with C-034/C-007/C-033 in later chapters).
- Open continuity note: confirm whether the witness who withheld full identity is linked to lawful delay mechanisms (`DOC-004` #13 style, C-036 later) without requiring last-minute confession.

## Draft Log

- Completed full prose draft for Chapter 3 in the required section format.
- Implemented planned revelations from `DOC-004` and clue placements `C-006`, `C-007`, and `C-008` while preserving fair-play constraints from `DOC-005`.
- Reworked emotional progression from institutional shock toward operational urgency and suspicion of coordinated access bypass.
- Added explicit red herring path through overworked-clerk arithmetic and possible dismissed-internal explanation for signature mismatch.
- Added dependency and continuation notes for downstream chapters, especially the access and records-control branches in `DOC-006` and `DOC-005`.
- Chapter to be post-mortemed for final word count and continuity compression before status upgrade to `ready_for_review`.
