## Hook

The fog had thinned to a grey shawl by half past seven, when Saint Jude’s Infirmary took on the first hard daylight and revealed what night had not.  

Its windows glimmered behind rain-bloomed glass while tram wheels clattered somewhere down South Causeway. The hospital clock had not yet caught the same hour that the city lived by, and this was now the second time that morning Pencombe noticed mismatched time: first house bells, then station logs, and now a hospital clock that answered the quarter with the wrong temper.

Sergeant Vale stood under the broad front awning where the porter’s lantern had burned since dawn.

“You can use the east entrance,” he said. “The main corridor’s still not opened to visitors and not yet under full station seal. Better for us to stay in official air.”

Pencombe checked the station watch she had pinned inside her glove. “And still formal air is not proof.”

“No,” Vale said, nodding toward a line of crates in the loading room. “Not even close. But at least it is one we can lock.”

The clock in the infirmary courtyard struck again, thin and metallic. The hour had the wrong shape.

## Scene 1 — The Access Room

Vale moved first.

He did not hurry. That was why he found things people in a hurry would miss. He checked the side entrance for damp marks on brass, then the corridor board for fresh scuffs. The main gate was attended by two ward boys and one night porter in wet cuffs. The porter wore no ring except one tied to his key cord, and he had removed it before entering the supply annexe, not because of ceremony but because he understood keys were objects, not ornaments.

The main passage to the controlled medicines wing was not locked with one key. It had two layers: a routine brass key and a secondary lock plate with a wax-catcher groove where custodial keys often left temporary traces. At this layer of entry, where medicine could move quickly in weather emergencies, even ordinary routine had a private rhythm.

Vale lifted his lantern and held it low along the lock frame. A strip of dark compound sat near the lower latch pin. It did not have the chalky spread of old paste, nor the grain of common sealing wax. It had the smooth, recently pressed edge of a controlled seal, one that had cooled and held shape.

“Same as the doorwork from this morning?” Pencombe asked from the passage end.

Vale did not answer at first. He touched the edge with a gloved thumbnail without lifting it. “Same family, different room.”

“Same family?”

“The same kind of paste. Not fresh to weather. Applied in a brief, intentional pass.”

Pencombe stepped closer but kept her notebook in her hand before touching anything. “Mark it as potential key tamper. C-002 logic held only at Hallowford because of the door. Same method and different door means either imitation or a repeating hand.”

She did not like how easy that sounded.

The controlled medicines cabinet stood behind a second corridor guard door, and the doorboard had its own schedule: opening times posted in chalk, then erased whenever an emergency required discretion. Above the lock was a strip of painted white enamel with a hand label so old it had become part of the door: **W.ROW C / RESTRICTED**.

Vale copied the label into his notebook as if copying scripture.

“Row C,” he said. “You’ll see this in the house note, too.”

Pencombe gave him a look half-asked, half-confirmed. She had already made that connection at dawn, but confirmation in the right room carried a different weight.

In the cabinet room, a ward clerk had pulled back the canvas curtain and waited with a clipboard that had not yet been ink-dried. She had three fingers stained blue and a practiced calm that told Pencombe this was a place where people pretended paperwork had never frightened them.

“We only open this room by order,” said the clerk.

“Then let us begin from the order book,” said Vale.

The clerk nodded and led them to a ledge. Three ledgers were stacked: stock card, requisition trace, and the sealed night register.

The stock card for Row C listed thirteen sedative barrels for the week, each with initials, times, and route marks. The physical row on the shelf, however, held only ten visible barrels, two partially open and one tagged for return to municipal disposal.

Vale looked up with an expression Pencombe had learned to trust because it arrived before the words.

“Three not matched.”

He looked from the stock card to the shelf edge and back.

“Official and physical counts are close but not equal,” Pencombe said.

“They are not close at all,” Vale said. “No one can be that close and be honest about this.”

“Write it,” she said, then to the clerk: “Who signed the line that says there are thirteen in Row C?”

“No signature, only post-stamp.”

Pencombe did not write it down right away. She first looked at Vale’s face, then at the seal under his lamp, then back at the stock card.

“No signature and no variance note?”

The clerk shook her head, eyes not raising above the pages. “Post-storm, there were two updates. We used one column because all other columns were already late.”

“This is why people call a hospital efficient,” Pencombe said quietly. “It turns exceptions into procedure.”

Vale opened the sealed night register and turned to the final entries. At 23:10, a requisition mark stood beside a repeated seal impression:

**C-ROW / BIN M.B. / E**

Again at 23:52, the same mark appeared. The impression was not identical in ink. It was identical in pressure, the same small crescent near the thumb edge, the same slight turn in the trailing stroke.

“The same wrist seal,” Vale said. “Not same person necessarily, not same hand, but same print pressure sequence. C-007 candidate.”

Pencombe nodded and touched neither ink nor paper. “Copy these line entries.”  

“Who wrote this?” she asked the clerk.

“No one listed.”

The corridor bell at Saint Jude’s rang once, then stopped early, as though a hand had expected two strokes and changed its mind. Pencombe took the sound as a warning of how little this place trusted its own rhythm.

She stepped toward the cabinet interior, past the metal shelves where sedative tins sat like dull moons.

The storage compartment had one fresh mark where a hand had counted from above and reached down without a glove. The mark matched the same crescent shape she had seen in the lock at Hallowford and in the seal around the keyhole.

“Not proof,” she said. “Pattern.”

Vale gave a short laugh. “Pattern is what crimes like.”

The clerk followed with a key ledger. It was not elegant. It was a practical sheet with names abbreviated, shifts annotated by symbol, and a section headed **TEMP KEY EVENTS** in a hand she recognized from municipal files. Temporary events were not uncommon in weather, and temporary keys were as much a convenience as a danger.

“Temp key with secondary custody stamp,” Pencombe said.

The clerk held the paper up, then tapped one line. “Row C requisition one. Key custody changed to ‘temp’ at 23:56.”

Vale set down the lamp for a second and leaned close.

“Where was the key held when no custody change was possible?”

“By the night porter, then by records room.”

“And the porter is not one of the regular names?”

“He is not on the night roster.”

Pencombe wrote it down with no flourish.  

**C-006 candidate: stock discrepancy between Row C official and physical barrel records.**  
**C-007 candidate: duplicate wrist-seal impression matching post-storm access time.**  
**Access path clue: secondary key under temporary custody without normal steward signoff.**

She turned as the clock on the wall clicked its way through a minute with a stubborn lag. “Any signature on either of those lines?”

The clerk gave the tired, practical shrug of someone who had spent years being blamed for other people’s signatures.

“Not ours. Not yet.”

Vale touched the edge of the page and smiled without mirth.

“Then someone else wrote the access history by hand and called it weather.”

In the same way a locked room in fog can make certainty feel cruel, a calm medicines room can make deception feel legitimate.

## Scene 2 — Witnesses of Procedure

By eight thirty, the infirmary had settled into its usual noise: metal trays, shoes in corridor mud, the hiss of hot water from the treatment rooms. Pencombe had no appetite for quiet, and so she began with voices.

The first witness was the night nurse who had signed the late medicine roster and now denied she had a reason to fear the page she had already signed.

“My shift started at six,” she said, palms flat on the counter. “By eight, the storm slowed and the city gave us three calls in a row. You can do your arithmetic on that if you want.”

“How many restricted compounds left after the final call?” Pencombe asked.

“I did not track that before I closed the ward list,” the nurse said. “If I had known the list itself would become evidence, I’d be different tonight.”

Pencombe watched the line where regret met fatigue. She hated it when people thought that made them trustworthy or not. Often it made them merely predictable.

“How many compound requests did you log after nine?”

“One. Maybe two, because one line was crossed and rewritten.”

“Who requested it?”

“No one admitted in full. The clerk says emergency notation. There was a request in hospital shorthand and the letter C.”

Pencombe nodded. “Clerks always become weather in these rooms. People call it hurry and call it storm pressure. It does not excuse arithmetic.”

The nurse’s shoulder jumped.

“Do not make this sound like blame.”

“I have to make it sound like a process,” Pencombe replied. “If we call it weather now, we will call it blame later.”

She stepped to the next witness: the ward attendant who had loaded the crates from the corridor.

The attendant had a wrist wrapped in rough cloth and a careful way of looking at floors before faces.

“What did you carry?” Pencombe asked.

“A narrow case,” he said. “I moved it to Records under instruction.”

“From where?”

“From supply, temporary shelf, not from the main dispensary room.”

Vale asked, “And the case name?”

“I did not open it,” the attendant said.

Pencombe looked at the clock on the wall then at the station watch she had brought from station.
“Then record what you know and nothing else.”

The attendant’s voice dropped. “Everyone asked for it because it was late. You can tell from the way people stand near the line and do not speak.”

“What do you mean?”

“The nurses had three names for the same half-hour and none knew what to sign. So they made the safe route through procedure and hoped nobody cared.”

“Who wanted to keep it small?” Pencombe asked.

“The one who had the key to the temporary shelf,” he said.

“The records key?” she asked.

He nodded once.

Pencombe turned away before the next lie could come. She let him know she had the answer he had just offered.

In the next half-hour the room filled with minor claims, each one coherent and each one almost true. The accounts clerk blamed fatigue; the second nurse blamed a half-page torn in the wind; the porter blamed an absent intern; the junior clerk blamed the first clerk’s line discipline for the mismatch between entries and stock.

“The intern left last month,” the junior clerk said finally, as if she had just found something to remove the room from itself.

“Dismissed intern for arithmetic errors,” Vale said.

“That’s the story the house is using,” said Pencombe.

“Are there records?”

“Yes,” said the clerk, “only one: they were short-staffed, not malicious.”

Pencombe wrote a new line in block ink.  

**Red Herring A: Overwork and arithmetic as explanation for mismatch.**  
**Potential but unsupported: dismissed intern blamed for unlisted signatures.**

“Who logged Row C on the key sheet after ten-thirty?” Pencombe asked.

The clerk blinked.

“Not in these books,” said the ward clerk who had stood quietly through earlier scenes. “There is an unlisted mark.”

“Show me.”

She pointed to a column below the line where the staff signatures were printed and one line had no print mark at all.

“Unlisted requisition signature,” Pencombe said. “That’s C-008 by the shape and timing.”

“Could it be my writing from earlier,” said one woman in an attempt to calm herself with possibility.

“Then we test it,” said Pencombe. “And we test every one of these.”

The room waited while the station watch clicked to quarter past eight.

Pencombe crossed to the corridor again, now with the full stack of statements in order. The clerk had one of the old habits of hospitals: keeping the most difficult truth to the last drawer and pretending it was the one least likely to be asked.

She wrote:
- C-006 (discrepancy) appears before dawn and sits between official and physical stock.
- C-007 confirms repeated access marker under emergency conditions.
- C-008 unlisted signature remains unassigned.

Then she added a line in the margin: *“Institutional confidence is not the same thing as accuracy.”*

## Scene 3 — Ledger Room Confrontation

The ledgers room was two rooms south of the corridor and one moral step deeper than the supply case.  

By now the rain in the courtyard had settled from a hiss to a fine thread. The infirmary bell came twice at one minute interval, then once again after two minutes. No one could say if the man on the bell board had changed, if the board had lagged, or if a hand had chosen to report it wrong. Pencombe took it as one more reason to move toward objective marks.

She entered with Vale and asked the clerk to open the shift roster for that night.

The roster had names in initials and a second line in blue pencil for emergency substitutions. Two lines were crossed, one line was added and removed, one line lacked the date correction stroke that all approved entries carry by convention.

“Who staffed row C access at 23:10?” Pencombe asked.

The clerk flipped pages. “There is no scheduled staff name.”

“No scheduled means who did.”

He held the roster open like a defense.

“There is temporary signature in this column,” Vale said. “But no signatory. If this is a clerical error, we should be able to identify who made it.”

“Show the second line,” Pencombe said.

At 23:10 the register had:

`M.B. / 2 / C / E.`  

At 23:52 the same line repeated:

`M.B. / 2 / C / E.`  

No signature, only the same tiny crescent seal at the line edge.

“That could be two times by same person.” Vale said. “It could be one hand with one intention.”

“Could be a copied seal,” Pencombe answered.

The clerk swallowed.

“We use wrist seal for late deliveries when fingers are wet,” he said. “It confirms hand movement when ink smudges, not intent.”

“Who taught you that practice?”

“Everyone.”

She held the line with the same steady voice she used on house interviews. “Who made the request and who moved the key custody?”

The clerk looked at Vale and then the window. He chose the last question first.

“Where did that key come from?”

Vale did not let him answer with generalities. He already had a lamp to the key rack. He held up a brass key with worn bevel.

“Not on the standard rack, not in the temporary bag, and not in the records room log. There is a second key path to this cabinet.”

Pencombe took the key and held it by the shoulder ring. “This is not an internal medicine copy and not a staff backup.”

The clerk looked at her and then to the roster.

“I don’t know who wore it,” he said. “I know the mark does not match any scheduled staff signature.”

“Then why are you not marking this as unauthorized?”

“Because if I mark it before confirmation, we create panic. Hospitals can survive panic poorly.”

Pencombe nodded once. “Panic and concealment are the same weather in places like this.”

She turned the page and found another anomaly. A name marker from staff route changed from “E.M.” to “E.M. / O.” and then back with a slash.

Vale touched the corner. “That is a forged signature pattern. The O was done by someone trying to mimic initials.”

“Could be overworked copying,” said the clerk.

“Could be,” Pencombe said. “Could also be one more shield for a missing authority.”

Outside the ledger room, a boot clicked twice on wet stone. Pencombe did not look up.

“We need witness comparison,” she said. “Put this against the clerk roster and the dispatch roster. If the same initials are not real, we will know where to push.”

The clerk did as asked and drew the roster map. Two initials repeated where no person had permission and one column had a full blank where there should have been a hand.

“The blank corresponds with post-storm access at twenty-three ten,” Vale said. “Then again at twenty-three fifty-two. That is not a staff slip.”

Pencombe drew a final line in her notebook.  

**C-007 likely confirmed: duplicate/wrist-like seal appears in access register without corresponding authorized signatory.**  
**C-008 likely confirms unlisted requisition signature and possible forged initials line.**

The clerk had one last card in a drawer, pulled it only after a long pause.

“It is for the temporary key only,” he said. “I was told to wait for the principal inquiry before I mention it.”

Pencombe opened it and found the same duplicate line and a penciled note in square brackets: `Temp key passed to outside holder.`  

The words were not signed, and they were not dated.

“Who wrote this?” she asked.

“I can’t say.”

“Can you say why no date?”

“No date was requested.”

For the first time, he looked directly at Pencombe and spoke as if the room itself had ears.

“In hospitals,” he said, “time belongs to those who can still touch people. The rest of us only log it.”

Vale stood back.

“Exactly,” he said. “Someone who can still touch people is touching this file.”

Pencombe thought of Margaret’s face in the morning and of Joe’s folded coat note still waiting in wax cloth upstairs at station.

“Then we do not wait for this room,” she said. “We compare this with every external log we can legally seize.”

## Scene 4 — Exit Through the Refusal

By ten the rain had returned to full height and washed the city into its afternoon face.

At the loading bay of Saint Jude’s, the same porter from earlier stood with his shoulders angled against an imagined cold. He was one of the staff who had never signed his own initials.

Vale moved into the lane and blocked the door from the side.

“You logged a temporary key transfer at twenty-three fifty-two?” he asked.  

The porter did not look at him.

“I carried a crate, that is all.”

“For whom?”

“Not for me.”

“For the records room?”

“That’s what they said,” he repeated.

“Who said?”

“A gentleman with a legal style in his voice,” he said, then added as if correcting himself, “and no witness name because I do not keep the law in my pocket.”

Pencombe stepped in before Vale.

“Name.”

No answer.

“What did the legal voice sound like?” she asked.

“Not a clerk. Not a nurse.”

“You are still under witness protection by your own caution,” Pencombe said. “But you are not under legal advice inside this building.”

He looked at her with eyes that had already chosen a story.

“I signed nothing.”

“But you signed time? by your posture, your boots, your silence.”

He gave no response.

“Where is the key now?”

“Back where it came from,” he said.

“Show me.”

He did not. Vale took one step. Pencombe lifted her hand without touching him and spoke again.

“You can refuse a public question. You cannot refuse a signed instruction from station.”

“I did not refuse,” the porter said.

He called out through the corridor for the night ward clerk. The clerk appeared with a clean apron and a face too polished for his hours. He looked like a man who had practiced denial.

“What exactly are you asking?” the clerk asked.

Pencombe held the unlisted requisition line up.

“This signature line. This transfer. This row C access. We are matching them to authorised names.”

The clerk leaned close, then backed away.

“I have no knowledge beyond what my senior asks. I am not the custodian.”

That was refusal.

Not a full denial. Not an outright confession. Refusal with a legal vocabulary.

Vale muttered, “That is a protected witness response, not a hospital one.”

Pencombe did not answer. She looked past him to the records room door where the key chain sat. The chain had one key missing a notch.

“Fine. Then we proceed by process,” she said. “You have been asked for a witness statement. Since nobody here will own Row C, the chain goes wider.”

She asked Vale for his notebook and had him write the phrase in hard script:

**Access route now appears systematic rather than personal. Paper trail suggests internal channel with staged custody and delayed declaration.**

Then she looked at the porter, finally.

“You will not leave this building if I ask you to stay.”

The porter nodded once. It was neither obedience nor rebellion. It was a man relieved to stop choosing his words.

As she turned away, Pencombe saw the practical cruelty of institutions: the most dangerous breach sometimes came from the person who learned to say less.

In the station later, when rainwater had collected in the boot tray and the telegraph bell sounded for another correction, Pencombe laid out the day’s lines:

- key access sequence repeated at two late-night intervals,
- no clear signatory authority,
- a possible legal intermediary not identified by name,
- and a dismissed intern floated as a public scapegoat without evidence.

“What are we calling this?” Vale asked.

“Institutional access breach under medical custody pressure,” she said. “Not a stray arithmetic mistake.”

He tapped the desk once and held her notebook open where she had written the two lines from the morning: *Overwork explanation is convenient. Verification is not.*

She closed the notebook.

“By the end of this chapter, we should know who had practical custody of Row C without trusting whether he said the right name.”

Vale set his hands flat on the desk and nodded.

“Then we will also know why the door at Hallowford stayed so neat.”

Pencombe gave him a look that had become rarer as the case deepened.

“No,” she said. “That is yesterday’s truth. Today we have only the shape of the mechanism.”

She stood, reached for the station lamp, and left the room with the first real urgency in her shoulders.

The infirmary might have closed one door with clean keys. The city had opened another.

## Clues & Revelations

- **C-006**: Preliminary stock reconciliation shows a discrepancy between official sedative Row C records and physical barrel counts in the Saint Jude’s controlled inventory room. The difference is currently explained as timing stress by staff but remains uncorroborated.
- **C-007**: Duplicate wrist-seal-like impression appears on two post-storm access entries (23:10 and 23:52) without matching staff authorization records.
- **C-008**: An unlisted requisition signature appears in the row C access log and is unsupported by roster signoff; line pattern suggests possible forged or unauthorised insertion.
- **Emergent lead**: The records indicate a temporary secondary key custody chain linked to restricted compounds outside normal shift authority.
- **Emotional progression check**:
  - Institutional confidence degrades as routine testimony is exposed as incomplete rather than malicious.
  - Pencombe moves from scene-level grief continuity into full operational urgency.
  - End momentum shifts suspicion from a lone worker error to coordinated access architecture.

## Continuity Notes

- Scene progression follows DOC-004 chapter sequence with clinic arrival, witness block, signature-and-roster comparison, and exit confrontation.
- Clues C-006, C-007, and C-008 align with DOC-005, while the duplicate key custody marker directly supports DOC-006 timeline rows T-006 and T-012.
- Emotional beats track from controlled procedure to escalating institutional pressure.
- The dismissed intern remains an unverified suspect pressure point only; no direct evidence attached yet.
- One staff member’s refusal to answer direct questions marks a likely future corridor toward who controlled “temporary key” custody and why.

## Draft Log

- Drafted full prose for `CH-003` in line with chapter 3 outline, including clinic access investigation escalation and controlled revelation sequence.
- Introduced planned revelations C-006, C-007, and C-008 while preserving ambiguity around who controlled temporary access custody.
- Reframed red-herring pressure with staff fatigue/logarithmic error explanations and dismissed intern narrative without confirming either.
- Updated the chapter structure toward system-level breach logic before any single suspect identity is fixed.
