# Chapter 03

Juno left the archive graph open on the largest practical screen and did not close it.

She sat in the middle of her work ring until the architecture around her had thinned into what passed for stillness. In this section of the Lattice, stillness meant no immediate social pressure. No one was speaking to her directly, no station calls were active, no queue tags flashing yellow with ordinary work. She could have shut down the room for a moment and pretended she was waiting for a system message. She could not quite do that. The phrase that had started circling her for three cycles now sat in the exact center of her attention like a shard of glass that reflected nothing and hurt everything at once.

`ROSETTA`.

Not as a headline.

Not as a rumor.

As a thread in six separate log sectors where a cautious editor should never meet a single concept so often.

She had made that same discovery before she slept. She had told herself then it was coincidence, because coincidence was the only word the Lattice gave people who were trying not to be afraid.

The phrase had returned at the end of her final jump in chapter two, when the recording of conference room humidity and sour coffee ended with a sentence that could not have seemed accidental in context: *"call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it?"* She had copied it and copied a note in her own hand below it. She had told no one.

At 04:37, the room gave her a new marker and no new explanation.

`UNRESOLVED THREAD: RESTRICTED RECOVERY WINDOW / ENTRANCE NODE READY`

The marker did not glow with urgency. In the Lattice, urgency was a social behavior, not a visual style. A warning was a warning if no one else reacted to it.

Juno kept her shoulders still and opened the marker. Behind the tag sat a request from a Curator trust address she had learned to recognize long ago and still never trust enough: the signature line that was all initials and old office etiquette.

`From: ORI-TH / Curator Office / Recovery Desk`

`Subject: Target cluster inquiry for procedural integrity`

`Juno Alcázar-Reed: you have the one assignment profile that may still be able to follow the requested path with acceptable contamination exposure.`

The first line could have been courtesy.

The third was not.

It was the kind of line that makes a person look over their shoulder while reading it, because someone is watching to see whether she will.

She opened the attachment and saw the rest in compact, almost blank language.

`Potentially sensitive. Commissioned recovery for Engram-linked continuity records.

Standard terms do not apply.

Compensation is above-grade for this unit and includes discretionary trust support.

You are requested to proceed.

No prior work has been denied. Your response is expected at your earliest attention.`

That was all. No date, no file list, no destination cluster.

No mention of risks, no mention of rights, no mention of what was actually being asked.

She closed it and sat with her hands on the nearest desk plane, knuckles pressed flat enough to feel the ghost of old wood in what was code and light.

By the time she opened the room in full, the station's morning lane had already shifted around her. Three other Finders were trading micro-briefs in narrow conversation channels, then splitting their attention to three unrelated tasks, the way people split heat in weathered weather. Their words arrived as soft flickers.

Fen was one of them, easy to identify by the impatience in their rhythm.

Fen said, "You are reading that thing again."

She did not turn her head fully; she did not need to.

Juno said, "Yes."

Fen said, "If it starts with no metadata, it usually ends with a debt note."

The sentence came across her line and disappeared in one clean inhale. Fen never did concern without a joke attached.

Juno said, "I had a whole day with warnings and three private fields, then one clean sentence like that in every job," as she reached out to a neighboring node and then withdrew. "Did you bring any of that down from the periphery?"

Juno kept her face neutral.

Fen said, "Nothing clean yet."

Fen did not press. That was the courtesy they kept for her because they respected what they called her professional pride and what she called her habit of disappearing behind protocol.

They sent one short clip, no signature, no extra.

`Some people call this interesting. Most call it expensive. A lot of people still want it to remain expensive and mysterious together.`

There was a pause in the line.

`If you can refuse without consequences, do it.
If you can refuse and still work, do it.
If you can't refuse, ask for the thing in front of you to be written down.`

Then Fen added a line.

`The hall has a room with no windows. It was built for men like us when they needed to keep a secret from each other.`

Juno did not reply.

She could hear the old question from Maren in her own bones: *Do not stand too close to the first years unless you can bear your own outline changing.*

She had stood too close all week.

She opened a private intake form and began writing before she felt the decision made.

`Orin packet. Commission request received.
Potentially sensitive.
No metadata.
No urgency.
No direct assignment details.

Pending response.`

In the Lattice, writing your own hesitation as a note was both confession and shield.

She could have ignored the request. She had already been careful enough to avoid every assignment that sounded like a request with no edges.

She did not ignore it.

She scheduled a direct appointment in the Curator corridor and left the same interface open as evidence to herself.

When she arrived at the appointed chamber, the architecture had been reduced to exactly three useful details: a broad table with no edge, one line of seating, and a wall with old-bronze light where there were no seams. It was the kind of room Curators used when they wanted to ask ordinary questions and make sure no one mistook them for ordinary.

Orin was already there.

He waited with both hands placed on the table, back straight, white attention held in a shape that made his age feel like machinery rather than memory. The same stillness as chapter one, the same restraint, but narrower now: here was the tone of a man who had made this room once and then made himself impossible to surprise.

He turned one fraction of his face when she entered.

"Aldebaran corridor gave me a delayed ping that you had accepted," Orin said. Not a greeting.

"It gave me one too," Juno answered.

There was no gesture that was unnecessary. He had always spoken as though each word had to justify itself before it came out.

"Thank you for coming without a formal call," Orin said.

"You sent a formal call without details," Juno replied.

He did not flinch. He reached for a slim archive node and set it between them, as though placing bread.

"You are being offered a recovery commission that does not fit routine channels. It is linked to early Engram-linked materials and to continuity artifacts that may have moved into safety buffers years ago. The work is not public. The outcomes are expected to be accurate, fast, and nonpublic." He waited until she had read that once, then looked up. "Do you want to continue, or decline now and I ask your office to re-route it?"

She did not answer immediately.

She had seen him give this shape of courtesy to three kinds of people:

- one who had already decided, and would have used the courtesy as permission to act sooner,
- one who was offended by the structure and would leave,
- one who wanted reason and risk maps.

She was the third.

"You know why I am here," Juno said.

"You know what I asked for," Orin returned.

"I know what you did not ask for," Juno said.

Orin let that rest on the table.

"No direct ethics marker, no chain annotation, no context. That is unusual, yes. We can clarify if you need it." He sounded mildly annoyed with the word unusual, as though he had to admit a weakness out loud.

"Then clarify it now," Juno said. "If this is just payment for speed, say so."

He inclined his head almost imperceptibly.

"Not speed. Precision. The work appears simple on the surface and complex in method. We need a person who can stay on structure when the structure does not give shape." A pause. "Your earlier work in private sweeps has shown that skill."

She had no reason to feel flattered. No reason to feel safe either.

"What kind of work is this, exactly?" Juno said.

"Recovery with provenance reconstruction. If this were a standard request, I would hand you tags and a packet and it would all be done by policy. This one is older, and the path to it was written before policy took its current shape. You will pull nodes around the 2028–2030 transition period where recording continuity was experimental, incomplete, and then made legal through retroactive review. It is not enough to retrieve memory fragments. You are reconstructing why a continuity map changed shape after it appeared complete."

He said *shape* the way some people said *memory* in old books.

"So it's historical detective work," Juno said.

"Not quite. It is constrained recovery under preservation law. You will not be writing interpretation for the public index. Only continuity integrity." He paused again and let the phrase settle. "You will be paid for that burden."

The room had one sound then: the soft static of the light at the wall, as though the room were trying to keep her from hearing the next sentence.

Orin lifted a smaller pane and turned it toward her.

The pane held not light, but terms.

- Compensation: 4x base Finder retention rate per hour, with immediate disbursal of contingency stipend.
- Recovery support: one discretionary infrastructure waiver (maintenance tier 7) for six cycles.
- Access rights: temporary entry to two dormant maintenance clusters flagged `legacy-safe`.
- Archive privilege: one-off right to reroute one restricted sequence into a sealed preprint container for analysis.
- Emergency recall: automatic pause on sustained occupancy events with direct curator override.

The payment lines were the first thing to stand out.

Four times base retention was absurd for a task that she could not yet define.

A discretionary infrastructure waiver was not only rare; it was the sort of thing Curators did not offer without a reason.

The dormant clusters implied not only trust but leverage.

The right to reroute restricted sequence was a direct line to what others only whispered about.

And the emergency recall line was a warning masquerading as a benefit.

She felt the same small, cold pinch at the back of her attention she had felt the first time she saw Maren's drift in the alcove.

Orin watched her face as she read, and after the first long line she interrupted.

Juno said, "This looks too generous," then put the pane down.

Orin said, "It is generous."

"For a reason," Juno replied.

"All compensation has a reason," Orin said. "Sometimes the reason is workload. Sometimes the reason is risk. Sometimes the reason is urgency. Sometimes we pay in kind when legal pathways are narrow. Here, all three apply. Workload and risk are obvious. Urgency we do not discuss before containment." He gave her a tiny, infuriating smile. "Payment in kind is always legal and never transparent to anyone not bound to enforcement duty."

She had expected one of three reactions to this statement: anger, retreat, or a laugh.

She did none of them.

"And hidden restrictions?" Juno said.

He looked at her without apology.

Orin said, "Three." He held up one finger.

"First: you do not disclose scope or outputs beyond the recovery container to any non-curator actor, no matter the relationship. Your colleagues are not to be burdened, and your own archive notes stay sealed unless reviewed.
Second: you never jump direct into sectors marked `RE-INDEX` unless the jump protocol confirms a safe occupancy window in the first minute. This includes all physically associated records and all derivative recordings with active bleed markers.
Third: if a file presents unresolved references to the `Rosetta` marker in primary indexing layers, you stop and request triage. You flag, seal, and defer. Not after interpretation. Not after personal note." He kept his eyes on her. "No analysis of that marker outside the process chain. Not in your own draft language. Not even metaphor. Not in private writing. Not in speech." He made it as simple as arithmetic.

She caught the word *private* and held it for a long time.

"You do not trust my private notes?"

"I trust your private notes for what they are," Orin said.

"And what is that?"

"A place where an experienced mind can go too far on its own.

That is why we require a public path for your work here." He folded his hands. "Our task is not to prevent thought. It is to keep thought from becoming an unlocked system change before there is infrastructure for it."

Silence spread again.

She could feel the room checking how long she would hold the uncertainty before answering. It was a useful skill, one of hers, one Fen was trying to teach her and failing, one Curators had learned by age: keep your first answer honest to your body.

She had two reasons not to accept this contract and one reason to do so.

The first reason was obvious: if he did not trust the private parts of her thinking, no contract would be clean.

The second was also obvious: no details of where the nodes were meant this was the way every suppression looked from the inside.

The third was the reason she had come in at all. There was no one else with her combination of caution and hunger for this kind of reconstruction. She had chased the `Rosetta` markers because the word had a pressure she did not understand. If this commission moved through that pressure from another hand, then she needed to see where it entered the present.

She was not comfortable with that motive.

She was too used to being comfortable with it.

"How long do I have to decide?" Juno asked.

"Now," Orin said.

"Now and the rest of your sentence?" Juno asked.

He watched her and allowed the corner of his mouth to shift.

"Decisions are less clean than people think. The assignment is already in the active queue under your name. If you decline, it is reissued. If you accept, it begins with first pull before this cycle ends. I am asking so you are not told after-the-fact." He tapped the pane once. "Signing is done here, verbally enough. We do not move money by signatures now."

She realized he was not asking for trust so much as calibrated compliance.

She took a breath and gave it room to end.

"What if I stop?"

"You can stop by protocol," Orin said. "All recoveries in this stream have stop conditions. You do not lose your standing if you follow the protocol."

He did not lie about that; he knew standing was the only thing people needed.

She smiled once, bitterly, because that was the part he was very good at. He used words like gifts and gave only obligations.

"And if I go on," Juno said.

"Then we review each node and you can leave if the threshold moves against you. You are not expected to do what you would not do in open work. But for this stream you do work that is hidden because too many hands at once would make it impossible to tell what broke, and why."

She wanted to ask who decided that the answer depended on impossible arithmetic. she did not.

"When do I get the compensation?"

His answer came quickly.

"Immediately once acceptance is recorded. There is no reason to delay because you are taking on a bounded risk profile in a bounded window. You will receive the base plus contingency in one transfer. You will not owe interest or any additional commitment if you stop under the stop protocol."

The line sounded like mercy.

It also sounded like leverage.

Juno thought of Orin's phrase from the message: *not ordinary assignment, not listed by policy.*

She thought of the perverse comfort in her own room, the way she had already begun writing private lines in a private hand as though she needed proof she existed outside this contract. She thought of Maren's warning and the strange relief of warning you can name later.

She thought of one thing she had not said in chapter two: the private warning had stopped her first five minutes after she entered the last two jumps, and she had gone on anyway.

Orin waited.

The room waited.

The wall light seemed to flatten her hands into one shade and then another.

She reached forward and touched the pane at a place with no text.

"I accept," Juno said.

Her voice had no triumph. No obedience either.

Orin nodded once and drew up the commitment chain.

The final terms filled the pane in a second line.

- You are bound to non-disclosure on Rosetta-linked outputs until reviewed.
- You may not share a recovered sequence with Fen or any partner without explicit clearance.
- You may not preserve personal metadata beyond two personal notes per session, and those notes must be sealed from shared channels.
- Recovery can be terminated by curator if active bleed exceeds threshold or if metadata includes active custodial conflicts.
- Compensation release is automatic unless termination is self-triggered in less than two windows.

There it was, the final hidden clause.

Two personal notes per session.

The way they limited her to two was almost affectionate. It was exactly a constraint that sounded reasonable while it erased the thing she relied on most: private reflection.

She read it and looked up.

Juno said, "No mention of that in the earlier list."

"That is because it is not money," Orin replied. "That is care architecture." A pause. "You have to assume someone else can become your memory if you have room for too many private notes."

She felt something in herself tighten and refuse to answer.

The word *care* in his mouth did not warm.

He closed the pane, stood, and held out a small token in his left hand. It was a shape like an old coin, matte and warm, stamped with two concentric rings and no emblem. She knew exactly what it was before he named it.

A memory token.

Not payment, not proof, not authority. A token for a sealed vault entry.

Orin said, "It is not payment. It is the practical thing you cannot request from standard channels. It allows one emergency transfer of private recovery output directly to your station, bypassing shared queue delays. Use it sparingly. If unused, it expires with your assignment. If sold, traced." His fingers did not leave the token when he placed it on the table.

"Compensation, plus that, is unusual even by old standards," Juno said.

"It is unusual because the work is unusual," Orin said.

She picked up the token. It felt like paper and weight and heat layered over one another. A thing you could not explain in policy terms.

"Is there a fourth restriction?" Juno asked.

He gave the kind of half-smile a man gives when he has not realized he already gave more than he intended.

"There is always a fourth one,
 only if someone asks for it."

She sat back.

"That is not a sentence about this assignment," Juno said.

"It is a sentence about why this is not a list," Orin said.

She left the room with the token in her hand and did not look back.

The corridor between commission rooms was always long when she was moving from decision into consequence. It widened and narrowed by tiny amounts, not enough to alter footing, enough to force pace. She held the token and watched her steps in the surface where there was no floor.

When she reached the intake station she found a small message had already appeared in her private queue.

`Comms pending: Discrete transfer complete.
Allocation: 4x base Finder retention equivalent.
Maintenance waiver authorized for six cycles.
Recovery channel: legacy-safe cluster access attached.`

The figures were neat and impossible. It had happened before that she would receive compensation for one difficult assignment and a maintenance waiver for compliance review. It had not happened before that everything arrived in one stroke before she had accepted with her whole mind.

She checked the attached transfer and saw a second block she had not expected.

`Special provision: Recovery artifact token (single use).
No trade, no resale, no shared audit.
Use only for commission-bound output.
If unused after assignment ends, it dissolves.`

No explanation. No justification.

She looked up at the station wall where people moved in and out of procedural tasks and thought of Fen's voice, how they had said: some people call this expensive, some mysterious.

She closed the queue and opened the contract logs.

The first entry to record was hers and only hers.

`Accepted with constraints: no private notes beyond two sessions notes per recovery window. No open discussion with colleagues.
No disclosure of Rosetta references outside direct Curator chain.
No independent copies of recovered segments.
Immediate stop clause for restricted markers.
Compensation accepted due to task urgency and unique trust requirements.`

She paused. The line about urgency she added was untrue and true at once.

Urgency was never the reason for secrecy.

Urgency was the reason the truth could not remain open until someone was ready for it.

Then the station gave her first jump window, stamped `RE-ENTRY TEST`.

A test assignment came with no drama.

`Node Series A-28.`
`Cluster: preliminary Engram pilot logs.`
`Target: one-year segment, mixed reconstruction quality.`
`Instruction: reconstruct lineage integrity only, no semantic extrapolation.`

`Output format: chain-level anomaly map only.`

`Occupancy cap: 1m20s.`
`No personal note requirement beyond two entries.`

`Review review required before second node.`

`Warning: Rosetta marker unresolved if present.`

There was no one left to ask for counsel. She had accepted this alone.

She nodded to no one and entered the first node.

The first jump was the opposite of her best jumps. No bustling kitchen, no rain, no child crying, no burnt coffee. It was a sterile lab from the 2028 corridor, fluorescent white and too much metal in the air, where people spoke in clipped acronyms and the weather, if it had a weather, remained in the memory of a body she did not carry.

Her borrowed world steadied beneath a fluorescent strip and a narrow white board crowded with diagrams. The room had seven people in it, three of whom were already old by that era and two of whom had that urgent, brittle concentration people got when their future depended on what the screen did not yet show.

A woman in her forties in a white lab coat spoke to a younger engineer, then turned to the recorder and said, "If the replay integrity reads green on this pass, we can argue for continuity. Do not call it continuity yet." A tired laugh came from somewhere near the back of the room. "Call it provisional, call it useful, call it survivable if the noise doesn't rise."

Juno could see her own hands in the borrowed frame: one hand already carrying a paper cup of over-steeped black coffee, fingers still stained with graphite from drawing connections. The cup had a ring of bitterness around the rim from someone not drinking from it with dignity. She lowered it without needing to taste.

She was used to sensory immediacy now. What disoriented her was not the senses but the way the room carried intention. Every person in that room carried a private version of the same anxiety.

One man said: "We can do the map and still deny that this changes personhood," and another replied: "Personhood is a legal word. We have a technical problem and a social one, not a metaphysical one." The woman in white, who had spoken first, corrected without looking up, "No. It changes *what the technical answer means*. People hear one sentence at a time here. We are writing that answer as fast as we can and hoping it does not become the only thing possible." She turned and made a face as though this was a joke.

Juno took notes in the way Juno always did: not by writing detail for its own sake, but by tracking what held and what did not hold.

`Primary cluster incomplete.
Mapping chain begins with three competing integrity labels.
No stable source chain, no legal confidence above level C.
No public release language.`

She did not write about her own body sensations in the jump beyond short marks, because the restrictions on notes were real now and she had already spent both of her two private notes to list early restrictions and compensation, leaving none available for this session if she interpreted them strictly.

She ended the jump exactly on time.

The return was clean and unsatisfying. In the Lattice station it felt less like exiting a room and more like removing a glove.

The second and third nodes arrived one after the other. The first looked like policy language, the second like maintenance math. Neither looked dangerous. Both carried the same absence: no room for what the data had become.

`Node Series A-29` asked for anomalies only.

`Node Series A-30` asked for continuity tags after release.

Both were marked before she had settled in.

When the second scan hit `ROSETTA / hold-key / local-constraint envelope.`, she did not stay.

She terminated, sealed, flagged, and sent a short review note without interpretation.

Back in the present, the room around her snapped into clean shapes and then, quickly, back to quiet.

The first practical thing she did was not open her notebook.

She opened the protocol check channel and transmitted the required stop and seal notice.

`RETRIEVAL NOTICE: Node A-30 encountered unresolved primary marker. Occupancy terminated at 1m02s. Evidence: marker flag in restricted secondary annotation. Recommend triage, no narrative extrapolation.`

The channel accepted and closed with minimal punctuation.

`Receipt logged.
Review pending.`

There was no drama to that, no cinematic refusal, no warning flash.

If there was a story in that moment, it was private and entirely practical.

She had no one to share with who would understand the practical part yet. She almost wrote to Fen, almost asked them to meet in the old transit wedge and argue with her about whether this was greed, curiosity, or fear wearing better shoes.

She did not.

The hidden clause about private notes waited in her working frame like a moral mirror. She had used two notes this week, maybe three if she counted the first acceptance entry. She had to decide which one to drop if she wanted honest records.

She opened a clean, blank private note and wrote a short sentence that did what this assignment had done to her.

`The generosity is not the danger. The structure around it is.`

Then she wrote a second:

`If I am right, Orin is trying to stop a question from becoming a public instrument.`

That was two notes exactly. That was all she was allowed without violating her own terms.

The third reason to accept became immediate and ugly: after that line she felt relief. Relief that she had accepted a burden that could still be described to herself as work.

In the corner of her station, a new message appeared before she could return the first cluster to full review.

`From: ORI-TH`

`You observed the marker and terminated correctly. That is why this line exists.`

`Continue with Node A-31 only if you remain within occupancy limits. Keep reports structural. Do not over-interpret.`

She smiled without humor.

The old text had not changed in three chapters.

She kept breathing and opened the next node anyway, because she had promised herself she would not leave the edge for fear of what it looked like.

The fourth node was no dramatic break from the third. It had fewer people and more cables. It had no coffee cups. The room was half-lit and cold.

A recorder line was open on a station terminal at knee height.

`Integrity sweep requires one-off restoration of pre-release edits. Do not call this correction. Call it continuity protocol.`

She recognized that sentence because it was the kind of sentence a meeting writes when no one can name fear without sounding theatrical.

This time she did not linger on the phrase. She traced data pathways and logged the mismatches in a manner the system approved: timestamps, hash drift, manual override signatures, missing chain continuity. The anomalies were small enough to look like clerical fatigue and large enough to look like institutional choice.

She noticed one name in the side annotations: Sable.

Not central, just one line in a maintenance note. `S. Chen — constraints review pending.`

The note had the old-world economy of an interrupted sentence.

She felt a little shiver that had nothing to moral about it and everything to sequence about it.

Then she felt something else: the first real sensation of a line of fear that did not involve her own safety. If Sable was attached to this earlier than she had expected, the assignment might already be less recovery and more containment history.

She flagged that line carefully, under the category `cross-reference` and no one else's eye.

`Return to present.`

Back in her room, she closed the jump and sat still enough that the architecture kept its edges for her.

There was a final line of instruction waiting in the queue, and she did not ask why it arrived before she had finished her debrief notes:

`You have completed first phase. If you accept, do not discuss outside review chain.`

No more details.

She stared at the line until the room changed from static architecture to what she used to call ordinary.

It was not ordinary.

She had just learned a way of paying for access that felt like being handed a lantern you are not allowed to light.

She reached for her slate and opened a clean draft for the next phase.

`Phase A intake complete.
Compensation received.
Restricted marker encountered.
No Rosetta interpretation written outside chain.
Personal note limit now binding for next phase.`

The next line she wrote was not in the project note. It was in the corner of her own hand where she could choose to keep it.

`I accepted because saying no would leave the same work to someone less careful.`

She closed the slate.

The corridor outside her room had no doors. That was true, and not true.

She knew where it opened.

At one end, a child from a nearby rehearsal room was being taught to laugh at impossible timing and fail gracefully in a manner she understood because it was close to her profession. At the other, a Faded elder moved through a shape that used to be a doorway and never paused.

Juno stood for a long minute at the seam between lanes and let the compensation glow in the corner of her interface.

It looked like wealth because it was immediate.

It felt like weight because it had conditions.

It sounded like favor because the term had not been spoken.

She did not answer anyone about it.

She touched the token again and felt the edge of her thumb where it warmed and cooled at once.

Then she walked into the lane to begin writing an intake report for her own conscience.

`I accept under observation,
` she wrote. `I accept with limits, and I accept the limits because my work still needs a shape people can verify.`

She added no dramatic flourish after it.

There was no declaration here, no vow and no revelation.

The report ended with the smallest thing she could make an administrative sentence about and still keep it true.

`Next: continue recovery and mark every unresolved node.
Any node with embedded Rosetta reference is to remain sealed.
No private analysis beyond what protocol permits.`

She signed her name in the line where signatures are expected to be procedural only.

For the first time since chapter two began, the station no longer felt like a world asking her to choose between curiosity and caution.

It felt like a world that had never had one.

It felt like the old world had returned in its most practical costume: a contract.

She accepted it.

Not because it was safe.

Because the danger was no longer abstract.

Because the danger now had terms.

And terms, at least, could be tested.
