# Chapter 9 - Pattern on the Board

Ron woke before anyone knocked at the door, and before the kettle sighed, and before Molly set the first pan on the stove. The room was still blue with the first hour of morning light, and fog pressed against the high bedroom window like a hand that did not want to be left waiting.

On ordinary mornings he liked to lie a minute longer and pretend he was a wizard in a storybook castle where the world began when the breakfast bell sounded and nobody else was going to wake him by making jokes about his blanket. In this house, ordinary mornings had become very unreliable. The map on the wall had gained new pins overnight, and the pinpoints looked like little soldiers who had chosen the wrong battlefield.

Harry was already in the doorway when Ron got out of bed. Harry had his hand on the doorframe and the look of someone who had already done two things at once—listened and decided not to panic about it yet.

"You look as if you've won an argument with an insubstantial thing," Ron said, pushing sleeves up.

"I won one with a kettle," said Harry. "It's still boiling after I won."

Ron snorted. "That sounds like a good sign."

Harry leaned in. "Ginny left you a drawing on the table yesterday, in the kitchen. Bill was looking at it again when I passed, and he said it's exactly what he had from the notes Gus brought up yesterday. The one on Gus's tin case and the one on the underlook map." He did not offer details, only facts.

Ron went very still. For a second he looked almost amused. Then he moved. "In there?"

"She doesn't move it if she means it for no one," Harry said, "and she forgot where she put it."

By the time Ron reached the foot of the stairs, he could smell toast and cinnamon and the first wet cloth of a Californian morning. The house sounded wrong in its right way: chairs scraped but no one laughed too early, voices moved in low register. It was a day when no one expected to pretend this was a holiday with weather in its own voice.

At the table Arthur was studying a sheet of paper as if it might confess. Bill stood beside him with one hand on the edge of a chair. Fred and George were pretending to be invisible behind a pile of fruit, and Marisol had one shoe already on, the other still in her hand, like a messenger who had changed her mind.

"Well, if this isn't the only day everyone brought themselves to breakfast looking as if they expected a summons," Arthur said without looking up.

"What's a summons for, Arthur?" said Ron, dropping onto the bench and trying not to sit too heavily.

"Sometimes the body remembers in advance what the day will ask," Arthur said.

Bill's eyes moved to Ron. "We need you at the table before we go from guessing to acting. Bring your chessboard head and your patience. Ginny's notebook is here too. She left it open by mistake. Or intentionally. Either way we can't un-see the symbol now."

Ron looked at Harry. Harry lifted one shoulder. "Ginny asked me to put it in the pot room for safety and then forgot where she put it. She did not say why. She might still be in the corridor with it in her hand and pretending she is not guilty of that.

Bill gave Ron the notebook as if handing over a live wire. "It started as sketching. I want you to look at it as data. Start there. Then maybe you can look at us all like pieces with names and positions."

Ron flipped open the worn notebook. The first three pages were ordinary—the fountain of a fountain pen, the angle of a market stall, Marisol's note at one edge: *Record everything*. Then the symbols began again. The familiar shape, copied in three sizes and two inks, with tiny variations at one side.

He did not need Bill to say the line was important. It was there like a nail hammered into the paper and the whole house had one hand reaching for that nail from every direction.

"Is this the one from the stairwell at Coit?" Ron asked.

"That one and two others," said Bill. "At the Alcatraz seam first ring. And the one she drew at the deck where the fog pooled. Same structure, Ron. Same geometry. I thought she was being observant and maybe frightened in the right way. I think she's been accurate enough for this to stop being pretty and start being operational."

Arthur poured tea into four cups and set them down in front of Ron and Bill. The room felt suddenly formal, as if the kettle had started a trial.

"I'm no ward-breaker," Ron said, looking down at the marks.

"I'm not asking you to be one," Bill answered. "I'm asking you to do what you do better than any of us when it's no one else's turn. Compare the positions, not the shapes. If it is random, we keep calm and keep records. If it is intentional, we find where it points."

Ron turned to Harry. "You found this where?"

"She carried it around in her bag for three days, maybe longer. After class, after the waterfront look, after tonight's tea. She doesn't talk to herself about this because she knows no one likes a prophet in our house."

Ron gave him a glance that could have been gratitude if it had ever happened before. "She'd better be right."

Harry shrugged. "She is usually better than people think she's allowed to be.
"

Molly came in then with bread and the kind of bright expression she used when she had made up her mind on a difficult plan. "There are two rules for any house with children and danger," she said. "One, keep the food hot. Two, stop pretending everyone can hide from what the grown-ups do."

She set down the tray with a firmness that made the argument feel manageable.

Ron nodded. "Yes, Mum. We are not hiding in style and we are not hiding at all." He slid the notebook closer to the lamp.

There was a practical moment then when Arthur asked everyone to push aside whatever was not useful. Fred and George gave him upturned cups and sat, still grinning in a careful way.

"Let's not forget the twins," Arthur said, nodding to them. "If we go through all this like men arguing over chess pieces, we will have them at our shoulders asking when they can come up with the plan. They don't ask because they are insufferable. They ask because they have already seen enough to know we are in the middle of it."

Ron wanted to snort but didn't. Instead he tapped the first page and began arranging notes in front of him like an actual game he could win by attention.

---

By nine that morning, Ron had moved into the old sitting room with the long table and a lamp that made everything seem both too serious and somehow right. He had laid out the notebook, sheets from chapter six and chapter seven, the map of the city pins from Bill, and old chalk marks from Arthur's bus route map.

He lined up the evidence into categories the way he had done for years with chess problems:

- Symbols observed
- Physical markers
- Disturbance reports
- Tide-linked timing
- Routes used by vessels or carts

He made no speech. He only worked.

"This is what I mean by not being dramatic," he said to no one at first, mostly to his own shoulders. "A symbol by itself is just a mark. A mark repeated in places where systems change is a pattern. A pattern repeated with time windows is a plan."

Ron's first pass was wrong. It made too neat a line from Coit to Alcatraz to Fog Hollow and called it there. His second pass looked almost childish: he used chess pieces as stand-ins for each location.

A knight for the ferry point.

A bishop for the church lane ring.

A rook for the warehouse gate.

A pawn for each place the symbol had appeared in service access.

He moved them while he wrote.

"You're not allowed to understand the board unless you can explain the movement," Harry said, standing in the doorway.

Ron did not turn.

"I don't need to explain it to everyone yet. I need to explain it to the marks first."

He slid a bishop two squares forward and one side.

"This first line from the stairwell marker to the service gate is not a direct line," he said quietly. "That means deliberate placement. Whoever drew these wanted the reader to connect nodes by transition, not proximity."

Bill, who had come upstairs with two glasses of water and one expression that was almost reluctant admiration, leaned in. "You found that the first day?"

"No," Ron said. "No one found it. Arthur called it a ward seam and then decided not to panic about seams until we all stop pretending they are weather. I called it a pattern and now I'm trying not to love it too much."

Bill nodded.

Ron moved another piece.

"If this symbol set is being used as a breaker pattern, it should appear where a system has been forced through stress points," he said, finally looking up. "Not where wards are intact. At least not where they are intact enough to matter. So we should look for the weak points along the old maintenance routes and the points already tagged for tide events."

Bill folded his arms and answered in the clipped tone he used when thinking. "We have three categories then: visible, delayed, and masked. Ginny has visible and delayed from her sketches. Masked is everything else we still suspect but can't prove."

"Masked means we infer with high confidence," Ron said. "And if this is a complicit sequence, the masked points are where the operator is hiding under the noise."

Arthur appeared with pen and a fresh mug. "How far does your board go?"

Ron gave him the shortest answer. "It goes until everyone starts to look at each other and realize we may have been mapping a game while somebody else was moving to win it."

Arthur grunted. "Then show the move."

Ron pinched the bridge of his nose, then set the last sheet in front of him.

He began reading out the known points and time windows.

"Coit stairwell sequence at dawn, and the fog lane marker. Pier symbol on the crate-tagged crate, if you count the 11/9 numbering as sequence marker not inventory. Fog Hollow service ring with pressure pulse at late second watch. Alcatraz ring from yesterday's scan. And then three probable points from the warehouse and church lane, each with a weak signature, one on fog return, one at drift turn."

Bill interjected. "And the church lane signal at 11:20 was two minutes before we expected normal current shift in the ward. That bothered me more than any of them."

Ron nodded and drew a final circle around it.

"Yes," he said. "That one is not decorative and not accidental. It is a reset marker. You don't reset a sequence at random. You reset at the seam's edge."

Harry watched him and thought, with the kind of reluctant awe Ron usually had for chess endgames and chocolate, that this was the first time he had seen him speak like an old cartographer.

Ron took the old map book and marked the church lane point with a heavier pen. Then he wrote the letters H and C and A beneath it, then a long arrow to the old underlook line.

"What do the letters stand for?" Bill asked.

"The letters are useless if you don't know what they're trying to keep secret," Ron said. "But they stand for an undersea corridor path as recorded in one of Gus's old notes. The symbols and pressure points all sit on one network line. Not two. Not three. One line. A line that bends under public space and never stays open long enough to be casual traffic."

Marisol entered at that moment with shoes finally on and three mugs from nowhere. "Ron, if you have time for one piece of useful noise, we saw the same ring in the lower fish market drain and the gate marker by the old clock at the edge of the side lane. Not the same shape as your symbol, but there is an offset. It repeats when fog lifts by the minute but goes blind when it thickens. It's like someone is waiting on the fog itself."

Ron didn't look up at first. He put down the pen and wrote MARISOL in the margin.

"You and Harlan's people know exactly what they are doing," he said. "Thank you. Keep your own notes separate and send me every sighting with time. Same format as Bill asked. Don't guess the shape and don't guess the intent."

She made a face. "Do I get a medal for being told how to do what I'm already doing?"

Ron gave her his least intimidating look. "You get one biscuit. And if this gets us right, you'd better have the best biscuits on earth because everyone will need them after whatever happens now."

Marisol laughed and took the biscuit. "I'm on it."

He turned back to his map and spoke louder, less patient. "If this were a smuggler route, the marks would track cargo, not phase shift. If this were a local prank, they'd vanish near cameras and crowds. This is engineered from the seam outward. Someone is moving pressure through a corridor and the symbols are the sequence marks, maybe for timing, maybe for control."

Bill's expression shifted slightly. "Control of what?"

Ron shook his head. "That part maybe in chapter ten. But this much I can tell from pattern alone: someone is rehearsing the path for a single operation. The points are not a spread. They are a route with convergence. The route points inward."

He held his pen above the underlook line and tapped three points.

"Convergence at Underlook mouth. That's where everything lands. If we map this by sequence instead of by distance, we get one active node. Not a map. A target."

The room was quiet enough for the kettle ticking in the adjacent room to seem louder.

Arthur crossed the room in two steps and laid his hand on Ron's shoulder. "Then we do not wait and gather more symbols for the sake of certainty. We send the people who can move underground with legal footing tomorrow."

Ron nodded. "Yes, but with one more thing before we commit: confirm this is not one of those old ward tests gone feral. If it is, we're looking at the wrong adversary."

Bill gave him a steady look. "You're asking for a check on the symbol itself. I can do that." He turned to Harry. "Ginny's notebook. Did she ever note the exact point where she first drew it and what happened around it?"

Harry shook his head. "She wrote places and times in one column. Some are neat, some scratched out. She didn't write fear, which made me angry for a week because she thinks if she writes fear, it becomes a thing we can't move around it.
"

Ron closed his notebook. "That actually helps. Then the symbol isn't the fear. It is the trigger. The first time she saw it at Coit, she called it shape because that's all we had. We can keep that."

Arthur sat next to him and looked at the map like it might answer one last domestic question.

"If the convergence point is what you think, then every person in this house now has a role," Arthur said. "Not everyone goes down. Not everyone stays. But everybody knows where not to stand.
"

Ron gave a small, practical smile. "First rule for us: no heroics, Arthur. If we're going to be useful, we become loud only after we are done useful."

Arthur laughed softly. "That is a better rule for a family than any Ministry brief.
"

---

The room changed when Bill stood up and walked directly into the sunlight. That was his way of announcing one thing was over and another was now official. The map was no longer a table exercise; it was a command chart.

"Listen," Bill said. "I want a full reconstruction before noon.

"Ginny's symbol as-is is not enough. The sketch shows three variants, maybe more if the smudge is the fourth. One of them is identical to what I know from old curse-breaking records as a *release gate marker*. Not a reinforcement loop, not a perimeter warning. A breaker of held wards.
"

Ron looked up sharply. "A ward-breaking marker?" He had known the phrase but hearing it from Bill made something in his chest tighten. "You mean this does the opposite of strengthening?
"

Bill nodded. "Yes. It marks where a boundary can be opened or forced. You use it when a room must be entered under pressure. Dangerous if someone who isn't expecting it gets hold of it. It is not common in our world because everyone who learns that sequence starts by learning to reseal it, and very few keep it for bad use."

Molly came over then and knelt on the chair rung with one hand on her hip. "If people are using it intentionally, they're not breaking old things for fun. They are opening one on purpose and then moving through.
"

Bill nodded. "Exactly. At the same time I can see in the shape how this one is written for repeat use. Not one-time breach. The mark appears where a sequence is intended to be re-cast. That means they are not improvising; they are rehearsing.
"

The words landed with weight but no panic. Ron had expected fear; he got a mechanism. That was worse and better. Mechanism meant there was a plan and a weakness.

Harry was at the table, fingers on the map paper. "How sure are you?"

Bill gave him a hard look. "As sure as anyone can be before compulsion or a full proof from the underlook. I need one more signature set for certainty. We need one direct trace from a live corridor. Which means this becomes urgency, not mystery.
"

Ron folded his arms. "Then we do it now. Arthur, where are the logs?"

Arthur brought up the file. It looked less like a file and more like two days of family panic written legibly.

Ron scanned for points and times, then made notes in his own format, then moved three pins again.

"Convergence still holds. The pattern is geometric but not symmetrical. It's a folding sequence. See here—if we place the first point at Coit (call it C), then each subsequent point is mirrored not around a centre but around a moving point at tide stage two. That moving point is the Underlook mouth.
"

He explained as if this was all ordinary.

"In chess terms," he said, "it's like a rook that keeps changing rank because the board is rotating and you're still trying to keep your king alive. The only way you get away with it is if you know the next move before it happens."

Fred let out a low whistle. "You made our maps sound like sorcery.
"

"It's the same thing," said Ron.

Bill set one hand on the table near the symbol. "Then we can tell Tomo exactly where to walk tomorrow. She will not appreciate being asked to test this with a sketchbook and a guess. She'll take one controlled entry point, one legal witness, one escape route. If this converges where you say, it means the first walk can happen in the Underlook mouth corridor.
"

Arthur asked, "And what about the other disturbance points that are only probable?"

Ron nodded to his list. "Keep as probable until tested. But they are likely the same hand correcting for drift. The probable points are guard points, not anchors. The symbols tell them where to adjust.
"

Bill took a breath and looked at Marisol. "No children in the first walk. No twins in the first walk. No experiments with joke products near the entry unless it is pre-cleared. We keep this to professional footprint plus one or two of us who understand this network already.
"

Marisol opened her mouth, closed it, then nodded. "Understood. We'll keep the family safe and keep the night from becoming a story no one will tell."

Ron reached under the table and pulled out a small chessboard he had once used on long, late train rides with Cedric for boredom and anxiety.

"Then keep this in mind," he said, placing knight and bishop together on a corner. "If we start with too many pieces moving at once, we make no advantage. If we force one line at a time, we keep a route. That is not me being dramatic. That's just not throwing away pieces because you can name them."

Bill grunted in a way that meant he approved.

"We'll proceed in one line tomorrow," Bill said. "Official support from Tomo. Controlled access under dawn fog. Arthur and I, with one witness and one ward specialist. If the line holds, we bring back anchor points for the whole family to decide next step in daylight.
"

Ron wrote that on the margin: *One line at dawn. Underlook mouth. Controlled walk. Return if compromised.*

---

---

As evening went on, Tomo arrived without ceremony and with her own stack of papers under her coat. She came from the BMA office and left no introduction because she had already made three rounds with Arthur and Bill earlier that day.

"The channel watch reports came in," she said. "No one on this record is naming us. That is a good thing. It might also be a bad thing.
"

Her eyes scanned the room like she was counting exits by memory.

Ron gestured to the table. "We have one to discuss. Underlook mouth convergence from known markers. Controlled walk tomorrow at dawn, if your office can keep legal cover.
"

Tomo didn't move. "You think convergence because we can line points on paper, but what I have from official readings this afternoon says your map isn't the only one with that structure. There are unregistered pressure pulses along three routes. The pulses did not come from the city system. They came in rhythm with your family's movement through Fog Hollow in the past two days.
"

Arthur's mouth tightened. "Our movement?
"

Tomo said it like a warning. "Yes. You are no longer invisible as a harmless tourist group. We did not ask for that, but the corridor is being tested against you.
"

Ron leaned forward. "Who's testing us?
"

Tomo was careful with the answer. "No one with a name yet. We have signatures and one repeating marker. The signature appears with the fog-lane, yes, but the repetition has intent. They know what you have found or how close you are. Either way, they are watching."

Ron sat back. For one beat, his face emptied of certainty and replaced with something colder. "How do you know that and not just guess?
"

She pointed at the printout. "Because there are no weather reasons for this sequence. Two pulses at dawn, one on the same minute you were all in the map room, one on the minute after Tomo's office called for witness logs. Then a soft counter-pulse at tide change that lines with no active construction and no municipal utility update.
"

Bill frowned. "Counter-surveillance. Or bluff.
"

Ron looked from one to the other and then at Harry, then back to the map.

"If it's bluff," he said, voice low, "they're too close for bluff.
"

Tomo nodded once. "Then yes. We should assume you are being watched.
"

Molly came in then, drying her hands on a dish towel and making a face as if she were deciding whether to let panic at all. "Everyone needs something to make a decision. If someone is watching, we either keep going in a disciplined pattern, or we stop and become useful in the long run.
"

Ron lifted the notebook and turned to the children. "I can't stop us from being watched by being less curious. I can only make them pay for watching in all the wrong places.
"

Arthur gave him a small approving nod. "Say it in less dramatic terms: we continue by plan.
"

Tomo spread the papers and pointed at the one line she had marked in blue. "I can assign two field officers from this office for tomorrow's outer tunnel walk. They will be visible enough to be legal. If anything deviates from their log, we have stronger grounds than fear.
"

Ron exhaled. "Then that's the plan. Controlled line, controlled logs, no improvisation. And no one tells children the map is done unless we're ready.
"

Bill nodded and reached for the board. "We'll send to this tonight: the convergence point, pin set, probable route, and confidence grade. Ron, you wrote this.
"

Ron gave him his own folder without flourish.

"I wrote it for chess players and people with no patience,"

"Then we should all be grateful," Bill said.

The room seemed to accept the new shape. But Ron noticed, as families do, the one sound that arrived late: a scratch against the back window where only fog should make a noise, then stop.

He ignored it for a minute, not because he doubted, but because he did not want to prove it yet.

Then Marisol looked up from her notebook and froze.

"There is a pelican on the roofline," she said. "And not one of Gus's birds. Too still. It keeps its head on one side, like it's waiting for direction from somewhere below us."

No one moved for several seconds. Even Ron, who liked certainty, had to admit uncertainty had a shape now.

"Not all watchers are people," Arthur said.

"No," Tomo said, and she sounded as if she could not decide if that frightened her. "Could be a creature being used. Could be an animal moved in training. Either way, we do not ignore it.
"

Fred made an old joke that landed too late. "Harlan's pelican?"

Tomo gave him the exact look professionals reserve for children with useful courage. "If it is, then he has better resources than we thought.
"

Ron wrote one line beneath the map legend:

*Watcher marker likely in air, observed 20:47, rooftop, fixed orientation toward table.*

He did not put initials. He did not need to.

Harry crossed to the window but stopped at the sill and looked hard before saying anything. "It flew when I opened the curtain." His voice had no drama, only report.

Arthur went up the stairs for a look and came back holding one tiny strip of something in his hand, too small for fear and too thin for proof.

"Found this on the sill,” he said. “Not feather. A strip of treated thread with blue tar in it. Not local.”

Bill took it and held it under the light.

"From what kind of line?"

"Not rope," said Ron before Bill could answer. "Not utility. Someone wrapped signal wrap around something to make a pull test. That is intentional.
"

Tomo wrote it down without showing surprise. "We call that a trailing marker. Somebody wanted to know if the sill had been touched recently. It's the sort of thing you use when you are testing the habits of a target.
"

Ron looked at everyone, not because he wanted consensus but because they now had one. "Then there is no ambiguity. The line we're mapping is not only underground. It is above-ground watch as well."

Arthur's answer was a dry sound, almost laugh, almost not. "Then it is settled. We were not wrong yesterday. We're not wrong today.
"

Bill added, "And if we are being watched, we do not stop. We tighten.
"

There was no question now of retreat.

Harry stood with his hand on the edge of the table. "I'll stay with Ginny and the others at home. If any of them are approached by anything marked, I'll call immediately."

Ron put down the pen and gave Harry a long look. "No heroics. You call first, then decide. I hate this line in our family but it keeps us from losing three people at once."

Harry, who had learned the phrase from Arthur and often from pain, nodded. "Understood.
"

Ron turned to Molly. "Can you keep everyone from running to the maproom tonight?"

Molly crossed one hand over the other and made it into something like a seal. "I'll keep them fed and fed to purpose. No one eats panic.
"

Tomo stood to leave and then stopped at the door.

"One more condition if we're being watched,” she said. "No notes by open window. No pages pinned up for display. No obvious symbols out. We keep your house as ordinary as possible until we know what this is. If they see disorder, they adapt. If we look normal, they may keep overconfidence."

Ron nodded. "We're good at looking normal when we're terrified.
"

She gave him a faint nod of respect. "That is an underused defense."

She left. Marisol slipped out after her and the room stayed still long enough for the fog to seem to listen.

---

Evening deepened and made the house a room without edges. Ron stayed at the table long after most people had gone upstairs. He worked through the map once more and then again, this time with only known points and the minimum to avoid seeing what he wanted to see.

It was easier to be clever than to be precise. The board rewarded cleverness, and cleverness had nearly ruined him before. Tonight he forced himself to write plain facts.

He drew four numbered circles: C for Coit; A for Alcatraz ring; W for Waterfront/underlook approach; U for Underlook mouth.

Then he drew arrows with timestamps.

The sequence did not sit evenly. It had an off-beat, which felt wrong until he put it there. It felt right after he matched it to the tide tables.

At 08:20, pressure event near Coit.
At 10:45, warehouse ring.
At 11:20, church lane marker.
At 12:05, pier transfer point.
At 14:40, Fog Hollow return edge.
At 18:00, none visible.
At 20:50, watcher signal.

He almost expected one line to break. Instead it bent toward a point beneath all their feet and made everything else into noise.

He wrote in block letters.

*UNDERLOOK MOUTH: converging after pressure cycles.*

Bill found him there and sat in the chair opposite without interrupting. They had learned enough not to speak too fast.

"You changed the list?"

Ron nodded.

Bill read the notes and pointed to the watcher line. "Stronger. Route and watch, both. We do not improvise."

Ron nodded. "Then no one is surprised by what we choose to tell and what we keep quiet."

Harry knocked once and stepped in with Ginny behind him. Ron gave her a brief nod. "Not tonight. Not from your notebook. Tomorrow is one line and one line only."

---

By the time the table filled again it felt like morning again in that particular way families did when they had not slept and still thought they might be useful for something no one had paid them to be useful for. Arthur had his pen. Bill and Tomo had the threshold list. Marisol had a folded note from Gus saying his office at dawn open for any legal call. Even Fred and George stopped joking for one full minute, which counted.

Ron stood and read aloud, voice steady and annoyingly controlled.
The marks in one line:

- The symbol is being used where ward seams are intentionally cycled, especially in fog-stage windows.
- Every point folds toward the Underlook mouth, and the pattern now behaves like one operative target.
- This is not passive decay. Somebody is timing for pressure, then checking whether the room listens.

Operational plan for dawn:

- Bill and Tomo run the first controlled walk with legal witness coverage.
- Arthur stays above as backstop if the field team is cut short.
- No children go with the first team.
- If the pulse shifts unexpectedly, we break and reclassify immediately.

He looked around and lowered his paper.

Bill added quickly, "And no improvised entry without legal cover. No surprises. No heroics outside plan."

Tomo nodded once, as if agreeing to a treaty. "You will have one escort and one witness line from office logs. If a pulse shifts, you retreat and reclassify.
"

Arthur kept it plain. "We don't wait for perfect certainty. We move with enough certainty to keep everyone safe."

Ron set a hand on the map and looked from family to visitors. "Then yes. Investigation crystallized: one target, one line, one phase. If we move now with that line, this becomes response, not panic."

Bill met his eyes. "If the Undertow is what we're suspecting, this is where they meet us and we do not give them the luxury of confusion.
"

"Understood," Ron said.

Arthur and Molly moved everyone into ordinary motions: coats, plates, kettle, maps packed away where they belonged. Fred and George made one joke so quietly it barely cleared the room.

Ron watched Ginny slip out with her notebook, then heard the back-door bell and went to open.

He opened. A boy from the alley courier line stood with a folded paper and one of those small, blank expressions that means they have no role in the fear they carry.

"For Arthur. From Mister Gus," the boy said.

Ron took it and closed the door. The envelope held one sentence in heavy, fast script, with a black smudge in the corner.

*Underlook seal looked warm at dusk. Someone watched from north ridge. If you ask which one, ask why the fog moved before the bell.*

Arthur came down for it and read. He did not speak for a moment. Then he folded it and put it under the map sheet, where it could be found by everyone.

Ron saw in Arthur's eyes the same thing he recognized as resolve without appetite for delay.

"Now we know," Arthur said quietly. "No one else told us we were watched. The city is saying it in pieces.
"

Bill held out his hand. "Then we keep the line and keep moving.
"

Ron said, almost to himself, "Tomorrow we follow this line out of sequence.
"

No one in the room interrupted.

---

The end of the day found Ron in his room with the paper on his lap and the board by the window, the way he once kept chess problems when he had no room in the world for a full table.

"Harry had gone. Ron closed the notebook and wrote the final line he would carry into dawn in his own hand:

The symbols on Ginny's paper were not weather. The symbols were a door.

*Converged: Underlook mouth.
Observed watcher: at least one active.
Response: dawn walk + legal log + controlled exposure.*

He blew out the lamp and stood with the paper in hand.

Tomorrow, they would step from board to tunnel.

In the room below, the fog pressed closer to the glass. Something moved once beyond it, then held.
