# Chapter 6 - Alcatraz and the Wrongness Beneath the Fog

The fog came in early that morning, not as a wall but as a soft curtain with edges as thin as paper. It made the Haight house look like a ship in harbour weather, and the window glass held the light without commitment. Inside, the family were already arguing before anyone had decided the day had started.

Molly was by the stove with two kettles and the expression of a woman trying to keep six children, one extra guest, one father, and three opinion-rich adults from colliding at the threshold.

Arthur was at the hallway table with a notepad, pencil, and an old city bus map as if he had invented the place by reading it aloud.

“No one said this was your typical picnic,” said Molly, placing toast in front of Fred and George in strict sequence. “If you forget who said what before breakfast, we will make no correction. We will just not leave at once.”

“Mum,” said Fred, “is this the same as a tactical correction?”

Molly looked directly at him. “You can call it tactical, comic, or maternal. It will still happen.”

Harry, still tying his scarf, kept one hand on the back of his chair and another on the edge of the table so he could look present even while he listened. The room was exactly like the rooms he had known in the old house, only wrong in the opposite way: in one room you were always too small, in this one every voice expected room for everyone.

Arthur, who liked to treat every routine as an argument with reality, had already announced the day before he slept.

“Alcatraz,” he said then, tapping the edge of the map. “By lunchtime at least. There’s history and architecture and a bit of weather. If there is no magic there, I still learn something. If there is, we learn faster.”

“You promised a day for the beach,” said Fred.

“A day with this much fog and water is always beach duty if one is poetic,” said Arthur.

“Is that how you avoid bad weather?” said George.

“No,” said Arthur. “That is how I accept it.”

Ron stood in from the hall with his little folded notebook already full of prices and routes. He held out a crumpled map and said, quietly, “The ferry leaves from Pier 39 at eleven-fifteen. If we miss it, we do not get back until afternoon unless someone wants to walk the long way through three hills and no mercy.”

“You and your maps,” said Arthur affectionately. “You will be one of the family’s few people with useful weather intelligence.”

Ron gave him a look that said usefulness had become a burden. “I had to ask for directions three times by noon yesterday and call one wrong one.”

“It is not wrong to know where you are going,” said Molly, tapping the counter. “It is wrong to go nowhere with it.”

Bill came in from the narrow stair with his dark coat already on as if he had made the decision to be outdoors and had no patience for reversal.

“If we are doing a historical tour,” he said, “I suggest a practical rule: enjoy the architecture first. No one wand-floats to save the day, no one conjures a torch for the mists.”

“So no theatrics?” asked Harry.

“No theatrics,” said Bill. “At least not yet.”

Arthur frowned playfully. “You sound like someone who has seen expensive people at expensive museums get bored with signs.”

“Exactly,” said Bill. “You should expect the same.”

He said it with the calm he used when explaining a lock that was still locked after everyone else had moved on.

Molly passed him tea. “You have a face for this sort of day. You keep your mouth shut until your hands have proof.”

Bill nodded once and went for the door.

Harry watched him and thought, this is what it looked like at first when he had met Arthur in old corridors with old maps; the older brother’s confidence had always had edges, not volume.

On the walk down the street, Arthur made a game of it.

“People in England are very good at keeping their history in books and their magic in museums,” he said. “In this city, they keep both in stories and then close the door so no one can tell you to close it. See? Same city, different manners. This is good learning.”

“Arthur,” said Ron from behind him, “this sounds like you about to spend a fortune on a museum gift shop.”

“It’s fine,” said Arthur, laughing. “I am still negotiating with the same universe that gave them all these bridges.”

“At least you’re negotiating with bridges, not checkout counters,” said Ron.

Bill walked at the edge of the group, hands in coat pockets, eyes on the street as if he was listening for another weather front.

Harry noticed him. Bill liked places where old and new systems collided and where people forgot that one could be a little tired and still useful.

They took a cable stop and then the ferry. The pier smelled of salt, tar, gull voices, and wet rope. Tourists spoke in clusters so fast their words looked like fish-scale light. The giant gulls had learned to sit too close and steal fries, and there were as many umbrellas as hands.

“If one more gull learns the names of our children,” said Fred, “I am charging tuition.”

“You could charge in biscuits,” said George. “That sounds less rude.”

Arthur pointed at the water and gave his running commentary as if it were a sermon.

“Look at the way they build around old walls. See the black lines? That means someone rebuilt from what was there and no one agreed with anyone else about the shape afterwards. My city is built on argument and still works.”

“Your city is not my city,” said Ron. “Mine has one map and one weather report.”

“Your city has one set of rules, too,” said Arthur, “and this city says ‘trust your boots and your nerves and one less spoonful of panic.’”

The ferry moved past the city edge, the skyline breaking into towers and soft shapes where the fog opened and closed. Harry stood by the rail, watching the water strike the hull and break into bright threads. He liked this part: everyone pretending they were tourists and every thought turning suddenly small enough to fit in the weather. He liked that he was inside it with people who did not ask him to be brave as a test.

Then his senses pricked.

Not a loud thing. Not a clear thing. As if someone had left a door to a room and forgotten to close the latch.

It came with a pressure that did not belong to cold or damp. His left wrist felt charged then dull, like the way wand-light goes out when the batteries are not batteries at all. He looked at his hand.

“You all right?” said Ginny from behind him.

Harry nodded without answering and kept looking out over the water.

Ginny saw his face and did not press.

From the deck speaker, the guide gave the first of the day’s rehearsed lines.

“Welcome aboard. We cross under federal and local maritime routes. If you’ve taken this trip before, you know there are no guarantees about weather visibility. If you’ve not, you will remember this as your only warning.”

Fred snorted. “Which sounds suspiciously like a prophecy.”

“Shut up before the fog gets offended,” said George, too gentle to be cruel.

Bill did not smile.

The closer they came to the island, the more definite Harry’s disquiet became. It seemed to have direction now, not just atmosphere. He turned involuntarily whenever the wind hit from the waterline, as if a bell had shifted and struck behind him.

Alcatraz rose out of the grey like a sentence one could not ignore. Even the tourists, with cameras and hats, lowered their voices near the stone and iron. The old prison looked less like a fortress now and more like a stubborn memory of punishment that had refused to die.

The tour group clambered out by the dock and followed the guided line through gates, around the grounds, under metal awnings, then through the old cellblocks and service yards. A uniformed guide named Mr. Caldwell, whose smile had been practiced in every decade since the forties, was talking with practiced enthusiasm.

“You’re all guests on official territory, and for your own safety we keep to the established route. There are sealed portions of the island that remain under restricted status. Do not attempt to enter.”

Arthur raised his brows, politely interested. “Restricted as in closed due to weather or history?”

Caldwell gave him a practised laugh. “History, chiefly. This place keeps its own.”

“Does it keep people out,” said Molly, “or keep people out of itself?”

“Both,” said the guide. “And usually with success.”

Harry found himself liking Molly’s tone. It was practical, amused, and already alert.

The first corridors were ordinary by the standards of prison architecture: thick stone, iron doors, old signs, preserved chalk marks from old guards perhaps cleaned and then re-inked for visitors. Arthur was taking notes about hinge systems. Fred and George argued in low whispers about acoustics. Ron looked at the price chart and every exit sign like each was a chess board.

Bill moved with the family but not with them. He had that particular look that meant he was counting where his hands wanted to place themselves and could not yet.

Harry waited for a moment by a barred cell door and listened.

The stones carried an odd undertone. Not noise, exactly. More like an argument from another room that reached them through the wrong joints. It made the back of his neck prick. He felt the sensation again, and this time he did not look like a child startled by weather. He looked older by one breath.

Arthur noticed and stepped near enough to share a line with him.

“You feel something?”

Harry kept his voice low. “I do. Not all the time. Just... wrongness.”

Arthur’s expression shifted, not alarmed, not dismissive. “Different from cold?”

“It sits where memory should be. I could almost call it old and hungry at once.”

Arthur nodded once, slowly.

“Can be a lot in old stone,” he said softly. “Keep looking. But don’t stand alone if it feels wrong.”

Bill joined them then. He had one hand on a rusted doorframe and was tracing nothing with his thumb.

“If it persists,” Bill said, “don’t treat it as story. Treat it as a symptom.”

Harry said nothing. Bill gave him that half-closed look he gave people before they could speak themselves into panic.

The group moved into the old cell corridor.

Caldwell’s next explanation covered everything from inmate bars to transfer routes. Arthur listened with too much genuine admiration and not enough skepticism, asking how many bolts remained true and whether the locks in 1963 had been sealed by committee vote or emergency order. The guide gave answers with both facts and convenient omissions.

At one point they reached a wider chamber with old fixtures that had been converted into an educational display. There were old steel chairs, a wall map, and glass cases full of inert shackles.

“This is the wing that gave us the old reputation for certainty,” said the guide. “It looked secure, and it was meant to be final. Decommissioned in the year you just heard, and mostly mothballed.”

Mrs. Calwell gestured toward a polished model and said, “No operational warding now. Just preserved structure.”

Bill’s jaw tightened in the way it did when he had just found a mismatch between a statement and its consequences.

“No operational warding now,” Arthur said, repeating. “Might mean no one checks what is asleep in the walls.”

“It was never a problem after closure,” said the guide, too quickly.

From the side of the chamber, Harry saw the older Weasley eyes of Arthur and Bill both turn toward the same narrow doorway. It was one of those doors no one had bothered to remove from the architecture because no one had reason to. The brass lock had no label. The frame had gone dark.

“That one leads to the service ring,” said the guide. “We do not enter.”

“No one enters,” said Bill, not for the tourists, for Arthur only. “That line matters.”

Arthur smiled. “I think we’re safe if he meant no one enters this side of the city,” he said lightly.

“And safe if someone decides to test it,” said Bill.

The guide pretended not to hear. The tourists, with the excellent manners of crowds, kept moving.

When they reached the cellblock where one wall had a smooth patch of stone that had been painted over and repainted, Ginny slowed. She reached into her coat and took out the corner of her notebook. A habit already formed and accepted.

“That marker,” she said.

Ron looked. A faint groove had been set into the upper stone, almost erased by age. The line pattern was one of those geometric marks she had already drawn in chapter five, a crooked triplet and a gap.

“It looks decorative,” said Fred.

Ginny shook her head. “I drew this exact line twice. At Coit. Different place. Same mark.”

Bill knelt with a hand not touching it.

“Did you draw it for decoration or because it keeps moving?” he asked.

Ginny answered quietly. “I drew it because it moved and I did not understand if that was a trick of reflection.”

Bill stood and said only, “Show me your book later.”

“Arthur,” said Molly, not missing the quiet shift in his voice. “We did not come for a puzzle tour.”

“No,” said Bill. “We came for a walk in history with our senses on. That’s why it’s now harder.”

The line was dismissed publicly with a nod to the next room. But Harry could feel each person in the family hearing something that was almost the same.

The group followed the guide out of the public path and up a stairwell that ended by a glassed-over section of older corridor. Here the light was weaker and the guide’s speech had the deliberate cheer of someone reading from a card that had become a memory.

“And here,” he said, “you can still see the old acoustic choke points. Visitors are advised to remain in the marked lane.”

Arthur looked pleased and then abruptly quiet. “Acoustic choke points are useful in prison,” he said. “Less useful in fog.”

Ron, who was always measuring things as if he were playing a long game with invisible bishops, said, “Could this be because it lets one voice carry where no guard expects?”

“Could,” Bill replied. “Could mean many things if you know the old route.”

Harry touched the air where the guide had not asked him to. He did not mean to, but the wrongness there was cleaner, like a pulse arriving at exactly the angle one would use in a dark room to test whether the door was truly closed. His chest tightened.

He remembered fog in Coit, the symbol sketched in the corner of a stairwell. He remembered the way the symbol had looked at the edge of his focus, like it wanted a second witness. Here, the wrongness was no longer waiting for him to decide whether it was memory. It was active in the room, like a note drawn out before the word.

He turned toward Bill.

“It’s stronger if I’m close to the service ring,” Harry said.

Bill stared at him without surprise. “You are not frightened, just measuring.”

“It’s not fear exactly.”

“Good,” said Bill. “Fear would be late if this is real.”

“I didn’t ask for this to be real,” said Harry, then gave a tired smile. “I think if I had, we would all be elsewhere.”

Arthur heard that and touched his shoulder.

“This place has seen a hundred men tell themselves things were not really dangerous,” Arthur said. “Then it did what places do.”

The party had reached the point where there were plaques and thick rope. Mr. Caldwell, whose voice now had a little less cheer and a little more apology, pointed at the rope with a firm hand and said, “This is the end of the official path.”

“Official end,” repeated Arthur. “Which is to say the start of every useful story.”

“Arthur,” murmured Bill, “save your lectures for tea.”

The guide led the tourists back, but the family stayed for longer than the rest. Not in rebellion, not with drama, just with a slower, tighter attention. Bill asked about old access routes and whether any archival requests had been made recently for the sealed ring. The guide answered vaguely, used words about permissions and weather and maintenance.

“The ring has no visitor profile in fifteen years,” he said at one point.

“Profiles can be changed,” Arthur said.

“Profiles can be falsified,” Bill said.

The guide had begun looking at his watch. “I should probably mention I was not authorized to discuss this level of structural history,” he said.

“You did discuss it all right,” said Fred, and then added, in an impossible whisper of a whisper, “This may be the best history lesson we paid for this morning.”

Molly gave Fred the look. “I shall withhold your sweets.”

Laughter eased the tension briefly, and then Harry felt it again when a gust of wind passed through the corridor and turned the hairs on his wrist to needles.

At the old service marker beyond a stair landing there was a line of carved stone, now mostly darkened by salt and damp, but with a sharp point at one edge that looked recently touched.

Bill crouched with the practiced care of a man handling a cracked lens.

“Not a crack,” he said. “An interruption.”

He pulled a small case from his coat and took out a narrow brass compass-like instrument with three rings around the center. It clicked once and then settled.

“What is that?” said Ron.

“Field test. Old method. You can build a better one, but it still tells the same thing,” Bill said.

He held the instrument near the marking then rotated slowly.

The compass needle did not settle on east-west the way it should. It skipped, then quivered, then drifted, then finally held near a point Harry instinctively thought of as south-west before he could locate south or west in terms of any map.

Bill frowned. “Not age decay,” he said to no one and to everyone. “Old wards in this ring would bleed, not push. This ring is being pressed from outside.”

“Pressed by what?” Ginny asked.

“The question we can ask now without sounding ridiculous,” Bill said. “Somebody is introducing pressure into a containment sequence and it is doing so in pulses.”

He moved to the next marker where Arthur had pointed out an old gate line.

“See this one,” said Bill quietly. “Mold patterns and salt blooms line up with old anti-escape loops. No one maintained this last decade, true. But maintenance rot goes thin. This is not weather. This is targeted wash.”

“Like they are trying to make the wing breathe,” said George.

“Like they are trying to make it answer,” said Bill.

Arthur leaned against the wall with more stillness than he had used for a laugh in months. “I’ve seen old ward stacks in ministry lockhouses. They don’t complain. They die.”

Bill gave him the smallest nod.

“And this one is not dying quietly.”

Ron’s hands were already moving as if he kept score with invisible chalk.

He had one of the tour pamphlets and a pencil with which he marked lines. “Harry,” he said quietly, “if this is being pushed from outside, the pressure has to come through an entry point with access from a corridor of some kind. Service ring to service ring. That suggests multiple nodes, not one break.”

Harry gave him a look. Ron looked like he was moving three turns ahead.

“Maybe to where?” Ron asked, not as question but as habit.

Bill answered. “If I had only that, we’d tell everyone what we are afraid of. Right now we just know there are two old systems in play: this old wing and the channel route under the waterline.” He pointed to the window slit that framed the bay. “The tide channel is old enough to know every spell attempted near it.”

“Is this a private theory?” asked Percy, who had been quiet for the first time since leaving the house.

“This is not private,” said Bill. “This is exactly the way you test if a lock was designed to hold and someone forgot to close the manual override.”

“Arthur,” said Percy, “you asked me at home for a full itinerary because I am bad with weather. Would you prefer the same from your brother?”

Arthur answered, and the humour returned but thinly.

“I prefer the same from you as your usual style,” he said. “Give me a way to keep the children safe. We can discuss mystery with less confidence later.”

The guide clapped his hands once to gather the group. “Thank you all. We will now head to the upper gallery, and that will close the historical segment.”

As they moved toward the stairs, the corridor seemed brighter. That made the wrongness worse. Harry felt like he had just walked out of dark water and realized the surface was made of glass.

At the edge of the gallery they passed a brass plate set low, half hidden behind a rope. It was once part of a service access panel. The plate had an arc, three short vertical marks, and a missing point. Ginny looked back and saw Harry looking too.

“You see it?” she whispered.

He nodded.

“Same mark,” she said.

Bill caught that exchange with a glance and asked her for the notebook right there. She hesitated for one second only and then opened to the page where her symbols were drawn in graphite.

He stared at the page, then looked up.

“I could have sworn this was a coincidence in chapter five,” he said. “That was useful. This is no coincidence.”

Ginny turned the page to show the earlier marks from Coit. There it was, the same shape, and here, the same shape again.

“It appears in spaces with old ward transitions,” Harry said, half to himself.

Bill placed two fingers on the symbol and then stopped. “No. It appears where systems are being handled by someone who thinks repetition is a key.” He said it quietly. “That is bad.”

“Who says that much about key and repetition?” said Fred under his breath.

Bill did not laugh.

“Who says exactly what?” he asked.

“Later,” said Bill.

They crossed the upper platform into a sunlit corridor where tourists could photograph each other beside old bars and maps.

Bill’s voice brought him back.

“There’s a ward line here,” Bill said, speaking low as they paused near the edge. “See the slight discoloration in this slab? We’re standing on a deadened ring, almost certainly a containment path.”

“Deadened meaning?” asked Arthur.

“It used to carry active resistance against certain memory interference. Now it has been overloaded and then damped. If someone kept pressing from outside, they may think this is old and weak and so press harder.”

Ron said, “How hard until it breaks?”

Bill nodded once. “The right kind of press, not enough, not too much.”

“And not us,” said Arthur quietly.

“No,” said Bill. “It was already being worked before we arrived.”

Harry looked out over the water and felt the wrongness align with the line in his spine.

Back in the main cellhouse, the group had been reduced by half. The guide, more politely apologetic than his script had promised, gave them a final stop. Mr. Caldwell had the manners of someone who had practiced saying “and if you touch that, alarms trigger” in twenty accents.

“I must tell you,” he said, “that the wing beyond this point remains in restricted municipal care.”

“Care,” said Fred, “is what everyone here says when they mean they don’t trust you with old rooms.”

“Not without good reason,” said the guide.

Arthur, who had no appetite for antagonizing strangers but no restraint around curiosity, said gently, “We’re tourists and family. We are grateful this place exists. But some things exist better when a few eyes do not look for a story at the same angle.”

“That,” said Bill, “would have been a better way to say you need tea.”

Arthur shook his head at him and gave in a smile.

The ferry ticket checks came, and the family took their last steps through the tour center. Outside, gulls had gathered and one stood on the stone railing exactly where two lines of old wall met. Harry saw it and felt the wrongness dip. Then he realized he had been reacting to the bird’s stillness. The gull’s beak was yellow and too bright against the grey and seemed to track one point on the wall, then on them.

“Birds remember danger before people do,” said Molly, coming up beside him.

“Or they read wind,” said Ron.

“Both are useful,” said Bill.

The ferry return cut the noise into manageable portions. The group spoke at first in easy lines: Fred pretending he could identify each gull by personality, George making a wager about the shape of the undercroft, Percy's mutter about schedules now ruined by the extra fifteen minutes. Molly packed biscuits. Arthur passed commentary among everyone like a father with weather in his bones.

Harry stood with his back to the railing, fingers on the metal rim. The bay water looked ordinary again, but every surface held the same sense of pressure after he had touched the wing.

He could not get the feeling out of his skin. It was not fear for him alone, not even fear for the family. It was the sense that something old and deliberate had learned their path, and had waited. Waiting was the part that made it real.

Bill came and stood beside him with the calm face he wore when everyone else had finished thinking.

“You feel it still,” Bill said.

Harry nodded.

“Good,” said Bill. “Now tell me where it is strongest.”

Harry did not hesitate.

“At the service ring. Inside the sealed marker. Near the old tide slit. It came in pulses, and not random. The same place each pulse.”

Bill nodded. “And any shape to the pulses?”

“A pressure and a lag. Like a door held against a crowd and then released, again and again.”

“That’s specific enough to test.” Bill took from his pocket a strip of paper and marked three points: island service ring, stair marker, old cell corridor.

He added another point without looking. “And a fourth, which we’ve not mapped in public yet.”

Harry looked.

Bill pointed to his strip. “The mark from Coit. Same symbol class. Same kind of transition.”

Harry felt a small shock of relief at hearing it named.

“That was there too,” he said.

Bill looked across the bay toward the city and did not answer. Instead he said, “Thank you for saying yes to that. We do not have a ghost; we have a sequence.”

At the back of the group, Ginny leaned against a bench and held her notebook open. The page looked fuller than before, and she had drawn a margin around the symbol and three new notes in neat lines. She had added one heading in quick capitals: **ACTING SIGN?** and under it: **wing pressure / fog lane / repetition**.

Ron was looking at a schedule printed on the side of the ferry wall, and his lips moved. He kept his eyes on the printed columns and spoke quietly, as if he were trying to hide a chess plan from an opposing coach.

“Two routes from here to the old cell ring,” he said to no one and everyone. “One is official. One is not visible. The second one includes a lot of utility access. If the wrongness is directional, it should move inland along the old service corridor. That was where fog channels cross.”

Ginny nodded and said, “I drew it from memory. Same mark on a stairwell panel. Could be old lock notation.”

Harry said, “Could be someone forcing it.”

Arthur, who had overheard none and all, said, “If someone is forcing old places into doing newer things, they usually leave witnesses. We are not witnesses. We are visitors. We could still be used.”

“Can we tell anyone?” Percy asked. “Tomo? The BMA? Even Marisol?”

Bill’s answer came careful. “Not yet.”

“Not yet because we are not sure?” said Percy.

“Not yet because certainty is a luxury that arrives late in this line of work,” said Bill. “For now we have pattern, convergence, and the beginning of a mechanism. We need one more point before the city learns.”

“And while we wait?” Ron asked. “We say thank you, no photos, and go home?”

Bill gave him a look. “No. We say nothing until the right people can investigate without a crowd.”

“Right people,” said Arthur. “Who are they?”

Bill said, with no theatrics, “Your family, ours, and the people who still remember this place before everyone got busy pretending it is safely dead.”

Molly, hearing “quietly” in the first part of that sentence, had folded the biscuit box and stood. “If we make a call, we make it tonight. Not in front of children with questions and no answers.”

“Not no answers,” said Bill. “Good questions.”

Harry almost smiled.

Back at the house, the fog had thickened into white bars between the houses. In the kitchen, Arthur spread the ferry brochure and pointed to the island ring and service corridor with a pen that moved like a man making up a map in the dark.

“One route is records,” he said. “I can ask for old maintenance notes and maybe get an official reason why this wing exists in this shape.”

Bill cut across him with a shake of the head. “Not yet. Registry memory is edited to be useful. We ask BMA field first. Quietly. No public question, no alarm.”

Molly set down cups and said, “No calls in front of all of us until we know what this is.”

Ron nodded without joking. “I can still go to one store before dark if that helps.”

Arthur answered, “No.”

Ginny asked, “Can I send my sketch to someone in Fog Hollow? In case they’ve seen this mark?”

Bill said, “Hold it tonight. If it is right, we keep this narrow until it gives us a line we can trust.”

Harry reached for a biscuit and felt suddenly hungry. “Thank you for not treating me as an idiot,” he said, though he did not know he was speaking loud.

Molly smiled without fuss. “You’re a child in this house no matter what we’re discussing. Eat.”

Bill watched Harry and said quietly, “You gave me useful data. That still matters.”

Later, upstairs, Ron and Ginny studied the symbols over the table while Harry watched the circles Bill had sketched around the service ring and the city-side marker. The lines were not random, and Harry did not need proof to hear it in Ron’s mouth.

“Same pressure points, same sequence,” Ron said, rubbing his forehead. “Whatever this is, it repeats at the same junctions. That means intention, not weather.”

Ginny looked from the map to her notebook. “Could be maintenance pressure?”

“Could be worse,” said Ron, “but not this pattern unless it is staged.”

Harry nodded once. “Staged.”

Bill came up with a smaller case and a thinner smile than usual. “Tonight I’ll run private checks. I can’t ask official offices and expect discretion; if we share too early, we get witnesses, not help.”

Arthur put two fingers on the map. “Then we stay narrow. We test, then decide.”

Bill added, “If it is only maintenance decay, we save everyone trouble. If it is active pressure, we save everyone time.”

Molly’s voice came from the hall: “That is the best kind of sentence tonight.”

After tea, they spread a blanket near the back window, and for ten minutes no one spoke.

The city lights came and went behind fog in long ribbons. The noise from other households carried up: a laugh, a dropped pan, a radio playing a song no one recognized. It was a normal summer night in a family that was trying very hard not to be the sort of family that had to choose between normality and understanding.

Harry felt the wrongness returning from floorboards to window, narrow and insistent. Three short pulses, one pause, one long.

He stood and looked down the street where Arthur and Molly’s lights made the kitchen a small, warm lighthouse.

“Not gone,” he said softly, without moving his voice from private register.

Arthur, who seemed to hear everything that mattered, came to stand beside him.

“No,” Arthur said. “It doesn’t go away on a trip. It changes shape.”

“It was there in the old room,” Harry said.

“And now it comes with distance,” said Arthur. “Distance is useful. It means we can find it.”

Bill came up the stairs with notes and a smaller case. “I tested the points in the kitchen,” he said. “The same pattern skews in each place you and Bill and Harry named. I am not naming it yet. It is an active sequence.”

Ginny asked from the shadows, “Can we call it?”

“Not yet,” said Bill. “Not because we are afraid. Because we owe the living families the right to a clean route.”

“And tomorrow?” asked Ron.

“Tomorrow,” said Bill, “we map tide markers and service routes and decide if this is one room or a corridor. If it’s a corridor, we need the right answer for where it leads.”

Ron looked at the map with the focus of someone seeing a board where a move had just become real.

“To the corridor,” he said quietly, “goes Fog Hollow?”

Bill did not deny it.

He looked at Harry and said, “You heard the pressure. I heard it too. That is enough.”

Ron gave a small, unguarded nod. “That’s enough to stay awake.”

Molly set down cups and handed each of them one. She set hers on the table and said, “Then we all stay awake, and tomorrow no one goes anywhere alone.”

“No one?” said Fred.

Molly glared and then smiled. “That means at least no one goes alone thinking he’s clever enough to be useful. You’re all of you useful enough together.”

Later, when the family had gone upstairs and the dishes were done, Harry stood by the landing and waited for the house noises to settle.

He took out the notebook from yesterday’s pocket and wrote one sentence in margin notes he had not expected to write.

He wrote: “Alcatraz wing is not empty.”

Then below it: “Wrongness is being driven.”

He closed the book and listened to the sea-hum in the pipes and the fog tapping the glass. It did not sound like danger by itself. It sounded like weather.

Harry waited through one more minute, then looked down at the hallway where Arthur and Molly moved softly with the exhaustion of people who had made a family into a weather instrument.

He felt it again, and this time it did not frighten him on its own. It gave him a line to follow.

The line led under the water, under old wards, toward fog channels where symbols had no names yet.

Somewhere in the dark, the sea moved against stone as if testing a key.
