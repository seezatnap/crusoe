## Hook

By the time the station bell struck half past six, Brackwater’s fog had changed from a blanket to a wet hand on the throat.

It had not lifted. It had pressed lower and closer, wrapping the lanes until the gas lamps looked like coins sunk into a pond, dull and gold where they should have been sharp.

Inspector Celia Pencombe stood in Mire Street Station House hallway with her collar turned up and one glove in her hand, watching Sergeant Thomas Vale peel wet wool from his sleeves with the patience of a mechanic who hates wasted motion.

“Did you bring it with you?” she asked without greeting.

He held out a small evidence packet in a flat tin box, the edges already blunted by handling.

She nodded and followed him into the evidence room without taking her eyes off the window.

On the city wall outside, a cart wheel splashed against the paving, then stopped. Somewhere in the distance, the tram gave one metallic bark as it took the corner and then vanished into fog as if a sentence had been cut before the end.

If one listened carefully, the morning belonged not to bells or traffic but to paper.

The room smelled of lamp oil and damp wool. Pencombe’s lamp made a small island on the table, and she could see how Vale had tucked the folded paper in the box: not tucked to preserve it, but tucked because it wanted one person to touch only one edge.

She removed the second glove and took out the note.

The fold was tight, triangular, and older than the hour of its discovery. It had been folded to fit a coat pocket and folded again in panic.

Her fingertips, still cold from the stairwell, found the indentation where the ink had pressed deep enough to leave a memory.

She did not breathe on it. She set the packet down, set the lamp closer, and unwrapped the paper into six clean quarters.

The line was thin, slanted, and written in the hurried hand she had seen all morning in Joe Hale’s room.

`M-B 2 c`.

Then, below in a sharper hand, almost like two people had argued over the same margin and lost, there was:

`4 / R / key`.

A clinic shorthand.

She stared at it long enough for Vale to clear his throat.

“Damp from the room,” he said. “Could still be from his coat cuff. I kept it dry as best as I could.”

“It might be nothing.” Pencombe said. “It might be the first lock on the whole business.”

She wrote in her notebook:

*Note recovered from coat pocket. Possibly linked to Saint Jude’s medicine stock and secondary key path. To verify against clinic ledger.*

Then she looked up and added one line for him only.

“Send for Nurse Alder and whoever keeps the 23:00 access cards. We do it while the wet ink is still fresh.”

Vale gave the smallest nod.

Not a man who panics. Not a man who wanted more room in the room.

A clerk in the office window tapped a pencil on wood and then came through the door.

“Inspector, there’s a gentleman with a telegram form asking for a delayed update on the household case.”

Pencombe did not turn.

“Tell him the house has a body and no public figure is being served before noon.”

Then she paused, and after a beat said, more gently:

“Put him in front of the editor’s desk. Ask Miss Granger to come and hold to her line. No names from this room.”

Vale looked at the folded paper, and she met his eyes.

“Press won’t stop if they can smell blood in ink,” she said. “We keep them to weather and method.”

He reached for his coat.

“Method has gone to Saint Jude’s, then.”

Pencombe let him go and reached for the paper again.

## Scene 1

The note gave Pencombe six lines of work and none of its own.

At a table in the station’s side room she laid it beside the blotter from Hallowford House, then beside the keyhole residue report she had copied from the scene in the morning.

She did not ask the assistant to sharpen every instrument. She asked him to fetch a ruler, a pair of tweezers, and a copy of Saint Jude’s late-night access log from the binder rack.

The assistant stared.

“Now, while we have only one witness line for the house, we start with the paper chain.”

He blinked, understood, and went. It was all procedure, which was to say, no miracles and no mercy.

The fold marks in the note matched the side seams of the coat cloth exactly where Vale had found it. Not once had the fold edges worn against his fingers. No coin pocket, no loose pocketbook, no ordinary household scribble. This piece had been read with care.

Pencombe moved the paper near the lamp and saw where ink had paused, not flowed, around the slash before the number two.

“`M-B 2 c`,” she murmured, almost to herself. “Ward-bin or medicine-bay?”

In 1938 Brackwater, nothing in shorthand came free of habit.

She recalled the clinic’s internal map from the statement in CH. 1: medicine rows, compound cabinets, and side keys that opened only if paired with a house-style impression. The dead man’s world had not ended with a bad night. If this was his note, he had planned a route before he collapsed.

Vale returned with the access log and a mug of tea cold enough to drink.

“Here,” he said, holding out a thin book with wet fingers from the rain.

She held it beside the note and found the section marked around the same hour as his death:

*Night 0, 23:00 watch mark, bin M.B. - requested 2 vials, sealed.*

No signature.

No witness initials.

No margin correction. Too clean, and therefore too useful.

“Look at that,” she said. “Someone wrote `M-B 2` and then cut the rest of the line so they could pretend a figure was never read.”

Vale leaned in.

“Could be clerical.”

“Could be clerical,” she replied. “Could be somebody who wanted to avoid the words.”

She set the log down and marked the first full chain in the margin:

- C-001: folded paper retrieved
- C-002: damp keyhole ring in Hallowford room
- new candidate: clinic note tie-in under M-B 2 / c / key

She felt the page’s neatness as a kind of threat.

If the note was legitimate, someone had either signed to request a controlled item or staged the appearance of a signature request.

And if someone staged it, then the paper had become an instrument.

“How long since it was folded?” Vale asked.

“Paper says no. Ink says one hour to two after wetting. If this came from Joe’s coat pocket, it was folded with intent before dawn and likely held close to body heat once written.”

He rubbed his chin.

“And C-002, from the room?”

“Paste ring around the keyhole and now this line about a key. If this is not all accident, it is the same hand from two rooms.”

“Same hand writing and same hand turning a lock,” he said.

“Different hands can do both with enough practice,” she answered. “But right now our choice is simple: this is not a random household note.”

Outside, the fog had reached station stair level and the windows looked pressed with soot.

Pencombe reached for her notebook and wrote down the first full question she could stand.

*What did Joe expect to move from `M-B` into a key route at this hour?*

Then she wrote the opposite:

*What did he think he could keep from everyone except this paper?*

She read back her own notes and crossed out no fewer than six adjectives.

No one investigating a death in a respectable house had the luxury of adjectives.

A constable came in with a kettle and asked if he should call the clinic directly.

“Not yet.” Pencombe said. “First we verify if this belongs in any ward line we already know. I want the station clerk to check whether the clinic uses `M-B` as medicine bin, medicine-batch, or midnight-bin shorthand. If three meanings are possible, we keep all three marked red.”

“We use red for uncertainty?” Vale asked.

“Red for urgency only,” she said.

He smiled. “That means this is no ordinary note.”

“No,” she said. “It is either a key to a lock we can see, or a key to a lock we are meant to accept.”

At noon she had enough for first operational shift.

The first ledger was not complete. It was a hinge.

She would need the clinic’s own entry records, and she would need the station’s clock against the family’s.

## Scene 2

Sergeant Vale had the sort of face city streets made for practical men: weathered, unafraid of mud, but unwilling to claim confidence without a chain of witnesses.

At 11:00 station office time, he had already sent three calls: one to Mire Street clerical, one to Saint Jude’s night desk, and one to the gatehouse at Tallow? not yet. But for today, he needed only one thing from the station books and one from the clinic gate.

He found Clerk Harrow crouched over the dispatch ledger and did not sit.

“Any entries logged for Saint Jude’s between nine and midnight?” he asked.

Harrow nodded, then frowned at the thin register.

“Clinic uses a separate line for requisitions, Sergeant. Access times and drug logs are separate. You want both.”

Vale nodded once and handed him a slip.

“Cross both. I need who passed a key and who passed stock in one hour.”

The clerk clicked his pen.

“That’s not a normal pair, sir.”

“I’m told this is where normality begins to fail.”

He made a tiny sound that could have been a laugh.

“You won’t get it clean in one pass,” he said. “Saint Jude’s keeps a private shelf for sealed compounds.”

“Everyone keeps a private shelf.”

Vale let it pass.

By half an hour later the clerk had a page for him. One row had the mark for `M-B` access at 22:52 by Joe Hale, signed with a doctor’s stroke.

Another row, untyped but copied over the margin, showed a secondary request at 23:07: `M-B 2 / C` with no signature and no witness.

Vale’s hand tightened on the pencil.

“Can you see a second key?” he asked.

“Two lines, same bin marker, no same hand,” Harrow replied. “Could be correction copy. Could be someone writing without authority.”

“How long between them?”

“Fifteen minutes.”

The station clerk at the back tapped a bell pin against the desk and then added, half-apologetically, “Forgive me, Sergeant. There’s also one telegraph timestamp from twenty-six minutes into the hour, but this line says delay on route and no relay confirmation.”

Vale closed the ledger and lifted his chin.

“Send the line to Inspector Pencombe. I’ll bring this through official. We test all timestamps before this turns into a rumor.”

Outside the station office, the rain had changed from drizzle to thin needles. Vale stepped into the corridor and for a second forgot to button his coat. The hallway was a line of damp coats and anxious voices.

By the time he reached the inner office, Pencombe had the keyhole residue under glass and two cups of burnt tea.

“Any match for `M-B 2 / C`?” she asked before he sat.

“Not yet,” he said. “But we have one thing and one doubt.”

He handed her the register.

“Entry one: 22:52, Joe request, signed. Entry two: 23:07, same bin marker, unsigned, and possibly in same hand as your paper fold. Plus telegraph route delay marker at twenty-six minutes.”

She skimmed it and felt the air drop, which did not mean she understood yet; it meant she now had something that demanded confirmation.

“Twenty-six minutes doesn’t mean he moved twenty-six minutes,” she said. “It means someone delayed signal and maybe one witness.”

“They were already behind each other,” Vale said.

She nodded and reached for a clean sheet.

“At this stage, we do three things,” she said. “One, check whether the unsigned entry was in ink of the night or a later insert. Two, test whether `M-B` appears in family paper as anything other than stock. Three, compare station clock against any private household clock still being offered as authority.”

Vale took a breath and tapped the ledger.

“If this is right, the second entry might be the first line out of locked-room territory.”

“It might be the hinge into motive,” she replied.

At half past eleven station office time, with rain on glass and bell from the lane in the distance, Pencombe stood and faced the wall map.

She pinned the timeline now: 22:52 legitimate. 23:07 anomaly. 23:00 discovery window from chapter one. She drew the red thread from C-001 to C-004, leaving space for C-005.

“Call Saint Jude’s now,” she told Vale. “If the nurse on night shift can place who stood at storage between half past ten and midnight, I need the names and the witness certainty. If she cannot, we send someone ourselves before noon.”

He gave her one of those looks that officers share when certainty has finally found an object.

“We’ll need the station bell as anchor,” she added.

“Already on it,” he said.

At the board, she set the red thread for a second time.

`C-004` had to remain separate from the household denial and the keyhole paste. She liked separation.

She reached for her watch and checked it against the station clock, then wrote down the variance:

*Station clock: 11:05
Household statements: from ten to eleven with weather-affected variance
Unverified clock from corridor: no mechanical certainty*

“Give me your best estimate of drift by tomorrow evening if a storm clock keeps delaying,” she said.

Vale shook his head.

“Not by tomorrow. By tonight we need a corrected anchor.”

She nodded.

Later, when the nurse called Saint Jude’s and gave uncertain answers wrapped in protocol, Pencombe heard exactly what matters at this stage.

The nurse insisted the ledger for bin `M-B` had been checked by Joe himself earlier in the evening.

He had signed one line.

She had heard another whisper that there was “a second hand in the corridor,” but no one in official custody would sign that line.

A second hand. That phrase hung above the station like the fog outside.

Vale looked across at her and muttered, “No names.”

She gave no smile.

“Then we write the uncertainty as evidence.”

Before sunset the station clerk brought in the station bell book. He listed the lane bells, tram bells, and internal bell sequence, and each time he spoke Vale marked where times could have been warped by weather.

There was the beginning of C-005:

The house claimed one bell at nearly quarter past ten.
The woman down-stairs claimed one at just after ten-thirty.
The station record gave a delayed dispatch that made one of those impossible unless relay lag was intentional.
Seven minutes, maybe twenty-seven depending on whose clock you trusted.
Either way: contradiction.

Vale took this to Pencombe, and she felt the old case-turning heat in her chest, the one that promised no mercy and no panic.

“You’re not sure of the margin,” he said.

“I am sure of the conflict,” she replied.

She put the ledger down and looked at him with a hard, dry smile.

“Now we have a lead worth a week of rain.”

## Scene 3

By late afternoon, Margaret Hale had replaced all ornaments of grief with the furniture of control.

She received Pencombe in the winter room, where one lamp, one tray of untouched toast, and one old family clock made a triangle of light and silence.

Pencombe had asked for a private conversation and got it, with only a single maid waiting outside and one kettle steaming on a side table.

The room held scent of lavender from the cloth she had hung near the window three days earlier, and Pencombe wondered which kind of order is easier: the order grief allows or the order fear builds.

Margaret stood when Pencombe entered and offered a chair with both hands.

“Thank you for coming back yourself.”

“No need for courtesy,” Pencombe said, but she sat anyway.

“People are already at the station asking whether we suspect the house itself.”

Margaret blinked once.

“I have no wish to assist in a public trial before the ledgers are read,” Pencombe replied.

Margaret’s lips parted and then shut.

“He was never afraid of a ledger,” she said.

“Not of ledger entries. Of omissions,” Pencombe replied.

They paused over tea and Pencombe took no sugar.

Margaret asked then, without warning, “Was there anything else found?”

Pencombe set the question down and gave the expected answer without kindness.

“Your husband had a folded note in his coat. It appears to refer to medicine stock.”

Margaret’s fingers tightened on the cup handle so quietly that the porcelain might have hidden it.

“Medicine stock?” she said. “He had many concerns at the infirmary. He spoke as if the ward ran out of patience.”

Pencombe looked at her and held. Not pressing is a different form of pressure.

“Did he mention a second bin, or a key?”

Margaret lowered her eyes.

“He did mention keys,” she answered, “but not in this room.”

Pencombe heard caution and called it out.

“Where did he mention it?”

“In the train with me, once,” Margaret said, surprising herself with a faint laugh. “A private, foolish kind of talk. He said if one keeps records too tightly, a city can burn faster than a paper shop.”

She looked as if the sentence had made her cold.

“Was that in the months before his death?”

“Yes.”

“Did he mention who he thought might turn the records against him?”

Margaret shook her head.

“He trusted people by profession.”

“Profession is an easy word for betrayal,” Pencombe said.

Margaret’s cheek had gone pale under its paint.

“I am not sure what he trusted. Perhaps he trusted the old order.”

Pencombe wrote it anyway: *Margaret admits trust in professional order, not in person.*

There was a long pause in which only the clock in the hall made its small, accusatory noise.

When Margaret resumed, her voice was steadier and more defensive.

“Inspector, if you are asking whether I hid anything from him in those last hours, I answer no. But if you are asking whether I hid anything from this house for the sake of him—yes. There are matters a woman keeps while she still believes the roof stands.”

Pencombe leaned forward a fraction.

“You do not owe me a full estate inventory. You owe this investigation one protected fact: what changed between dinner and what we found in the room.”

Margaret opened both palms, then closed them.

“Nothing changed in the house for him.”

“Everything changed for everyone else,” Pencombe said. “There are two versions now: one for the family, one for strangers. We need the one that existed before both were told.”

The silence between them had the shape of a door they did not intend to open.

Pencombe changed tack.

“Clara told me he took a key from the sideboard and an umbrella and told her he had a late note to sign.”

Margaret’s expression altered so quickly Pencombe almost missed it.

“He did,” she said after a beat. “He had those habits. It means little in fog.”

“But the house clock and station clock do not agree,” Pencombe said.

Margaret did not flinch.

“Clocks are for servants when weather breaks. In this house, a person counts by appointments.”

“Then tell me whose.”

“His.”

Pencombe looked at the clock.

“His appointment to whom?”

“It may have been to the clinic. Or to the law.”

“The law?”

She looked down at her hands and spoke through her teeth as if she had rehearsed this refusal.

“It is true that he met with Gideon before supper. That is no secret if you ask the right house.”

“Met with Gideon about what?”

“Trust papers. I was not informed.”

Pencombe did not write that quickly. She wrote slower.

She closed her notebook and then asked for one thing more.

“Would you recognize this code if I showed it?”

Margaret nodded after one glance at the folded paper the inspector had copied.

“She would,” Pencombe had expected. Margaret looked at it with the careful distance of someone seeing not writing but consequence.

“`M-B` could be a medicine bin, or a bill-room index, depending who taught me to read it.”

“Who taught you?” Pencombe asked.

“Joseph taught everyone to know his shorthand.”

“Did he teach you this exact shape?” Pencombe asked.

Margaret gave a dry, almost amused smile.

“He taught many in confidence because he trusted too quickly.”

The line cut. Pencombe felt it.

“It helps us if he trusted too quickly,” she said.

“Yes,” Margaret said. “Or if someone knew he trusted too quickly.”

The room took that in and set it down between them.

When Pencombe stood to leave, Margaret said, quietly and almost kindly,

“Inspector, you asked whether I hid anything. I did not hide this note. I hid what it meant.”

“And what is that?” Pencombe asked.

Margaret did not answer at once.

“Perhaps you have not reached the part of this week where trust can be measured in words,” she said.

Pencombe knew that was not a refusal. It was a sentence.

“Noted,” Pencombe said, as she stepped toward the door.

She did not look back.

Outside, Vale asked from the hall, “Any opening?”

Pencombe held up one finger and answered, “A denial that means there is at least one sealed conversation.”

## Scene 4

By the time Pencombe returned to the station, the sky had darkened not with evening but with the kind of practical urgency that comes before the city decides to tell everyone it already knows.

The map board from Scene 4 of Chapter 1 now held five new marks.

She stood at the station table while Vale and the clerk from Saint Jude’s arrived with a messenger and two sheets: one from the clinic requisition and one from the ward storage ledger.

“The bin reference is in the ledger,” the clerk said before she could speak. “`M-B` is a short form for the morphia and bromide shelf. `2` is likely a pair-request marker. The `C` could be the clerk code, but not if it was written in Joe’s own hand.”

Pencombe took both sheets and looked at the line under a magnifier. The clerk stood nearby, and she could smell wool and rain on his cuffs.

“Who uses ‘C’ as suffix?” she asked.

“He can mean ‘confirm,’” the clerk said. “But we would usually not write that in a ward request. If it is a request to staff, it is not for the room.”

She held the paper to the lamp.

“Was there any entry at 23:07, this night?”

The clerk hesitated. She let the silence remain. “There is an entry. It is in pencil, no signature, and in wrong ink flow if compared with official supply line.”

“Who entered it?”

“Not on record. No staff witness. It reads as added after routine close.”

Pencombe looked up at Vale.

“Tell me again,” she said.

“One official entry by Joe before ten-thirty-hour, and one added with no name at 23:07. This second line could be a duplicate, a correction, or a concealment marker.”

“Concealment,” she said. “For a man who built a life on procedure.”

The clerk shifted.

“She told me to keep my mouth from the city, ma’am,” he said.

“She told me nothing yet,” Pencombe answered. “I am asking where the second entry came from.”

He met her look and gave up.

“They don’t want us to say one staff member added it after duty.”

“What name does staff call his?” she asked.

“That’s not the point,” he said.

“It is if the point is someone not on staff.”

“He had no right to use that form.”

“Then we already have the right to check the right to move that paper.”

She wrote in the margin: *C-004 linked to unsigned `M-B 2 C`, possible unauthorised ward access / stock handling outside chain.*

Vale had already sent the station bell ledger to the copy room. He stood near the doorway with a hand full of red pencil marks.

“Station dispatch shows the half-hour delay in relay around the same window,” he said. “Not enough by itself, but impossible to ignore now.”

Pencombe motioned him to continue.

“Margaret says trust papers with Gideon. She admitted a meeting before supper, maybe earlier. If this `C` lines up with the legal side and clinic side, then this is no longer household panic.”

Vale looked down at the board.

“Then what?”

“Then we move from locked-room puzzle to procedural breach in public institutions,” she said. “The household was frightened. The case is now about who could command silence on the record itself.”

She took a breath and gave him the task in one line:

“Put Saint Jude’s on controlled inquiry this afternoon. No interviews in front of house staff, no leaks to press. Ask for access logs from both gate and storage between 22:30 and 00:30 and every seal in M-B line.”

He nodded and took it with no argument.

At that moment, a constable entered with a telegram strip from office dispatch, still smelling faintly of lamp black.

It contained one line only and a hand-drawn pause mark.

A telegraph clerk had asked for correction on a delayed message from 23:17 that had not arrived at expected relay time. They had marked it as weather delay pending instruction from station control.

Pencombe read it and saw that once again the city did what it always did in a good case: it used delay as a substitute for explanation.

“Add this as C-005 precursor,” she said.

Vale frowned. “C-005 is the bell mismatch.”

“Not this one alone. It confirms there was a separate timestamp conflict.”

She made the explicit note:

- **C-005 (provisional):** witness and official time anchors differ by seven minutes across household and station systems in one key interval.

The clerk from the station gave a low laugh and asked, “You will make it all clean?”

“Clean enough for court and cruel enough for the truth,” she answered.

She took a fresh sheet and placed three pins where she could not yet draw lines.

First pin: House witness windows from Hallowford. Second pin: Saint Jude’s unsigned entry at `M-B 2 C`. Third pin: station telegraph delay marker.

Then she connected them.

The board looked less like a mystery and more like a machine.

The machine did what all machines in this city did under fog: it moved slowly while demanding certainty at the end.

She stood still for a long beat. Then she spoke to Vale and the two clerks.

“Scene one is done. We have a forged or missing chain for medical stock tied to a household event we cannot yet date. Scene two is a timeline mismatch we cannot ignore. Scene three is a family who protects more than we can accuse. Scene four: active investigation begins.

“From this moment,” she said, “that paper stays where it came from until we can prove where it should have gone.”

She looked at the note, then back at the city map.

“If we are lucky, C-004 leads us to the person who moved compound. If we are not lucky, it leads us to the person who moved the ledger.”

“And the body?” Vale asked.

She answered with the short sentence she used when she wanted no one to ask for mercy from uncertainty.

“The dead only tell us where they can no longer lie. It is our job to decide what they tried to prove.”

The room had gone from the quiet of an early inspection into the tension of organized pressure.

Pencombe did not remove her wet gloves before the first of the station phones rang.

A man in a soft hat gave his name as a clerk from Saint Jude’s and asked whether the inspector required records in person.

She answered with calm enough to count as procedure.

“Yes,” she said. “Bring the original access book, not the copy. The copy can wait until we can trust the ink.”

He asked once more, politely, whether this meant the death was a matter of medicine.

“I did not say matter,” Pencombe replied. “I said we have a note that points that way.”

That was all. It was enough.

### End of Chapter 2 Opening Sequence

The evening had no need of verdicts.

It would have time for them if it had to.

Brackwater’s fog rolled lower as she turned the station light down and sent Vale to fetch Saint Jude’s clerk records in person.

She closed the folder with a clean, hard edge.

The first ledger had not solved anything yet.

It had moved the case one rung higher, from room to register.

And that was always where truth waited, if it waited at all.

## Clues & Revelations

- **C-004** — Clinic shorthand appears on Joe’s recovered note: `M-B 2 C`, matching a `M-B` access entry in Saint Jude’s logs and the unsigned stock request pattern.
- **C-005** — Initial timeline discrepancy appears between household clock/bell memory and station/dispatch records: witness memories differ by a multi-minute window that directly overlaps the final pre-death movement.
- **Operational shift** — Investigative focus moved from locked-room geometry alone to a medical-log and records-control hypothesis.
- **Narrative tension increase** — A family protected detail (legal meeting and delayed disclosures) suggests institutional stakes are now as direct as household secrecy.
- **Evidence control confirmation** — The note is retained in controlled custody pending chain-of-custody verification against Saint Jude’s original ledgers.

## Continuity Notes

- Scene order follows DOC-004 for Chapter 02: evidence extraction (`Scene 1`), operational debrief (`Scene 2`), family-protective interview (`Scene 3`), and active investigative lock-in (`Scene 4`).
- Time-anchor requirements from DOC-006 maintained: each scene references at least one verified clock/bell/dispatch or log entry.
- Character behavior aligns with DOC-002 (`Pencombe` procedural restraint; `Vale` tactile-lane logic; `Margaret` consequence-first speech).
- Motif continuity: fog, locked access, bell/clock mismatch, ledgers, and clinic-code linkage all carry from Chapter 1 into Chapter 2.
- Open continuity point: `C-004` source confirmation remains pending original Saint Jude’s access book and key-custody witness chain.

## Draft Log

- Drafted complete Chapter 2 prose in one sustained pass with required structure and chapter sequence from DOC-004.
- Target escalation executed by re-framing Chapter 2 as the first evidentiary lock-in from household mystery to supply-chain suspicion.
- Set `word_count_current` and dependency status to final chapter draft values after `wc -w`.
- Confirmed continuity alignment with DOC-006 and theme progression from `DOC-007` (incertitude phase, procedural momentum).
