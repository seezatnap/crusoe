# Chapter 8 - Formal Allies and Failing Seals

Harry woke long before dawn to a house that sounded as if someone had turned the weather down and only left the pipes to speak.

The rain had not begun, but the gutters made a patient tapping all the same, as though the building had taken a memory of the sea and decided to repeat it on metal. He lay very still and waited for one thing only: the thought that came whenever he slept poorly and the day wanted to begin all at once, an old feeling from the Dursleys that danger might be a mistake about him and someone would arrive to correct it.

Instead the sound was Molly's soft voice at the staircase.

"Molly's up early," he heard her murmur. "I told him no one gets out to buy tea before the kettle settles."

Which him?

Arthur.

Harry smiled into the dark. He had once thought Arthur was a man made entirely of plans, lists, and practical questions. After a week in San Francisco he knew another part: Arthur believed in waking before trouble and offering it an early seat, so you could look it in the eye before it looked you over.

Downstairs, chair legs on tile gave way to a map unrolling.

"Morning," Arthur said without turning. He had a cup in one hand and the edge of a notebook in the other. The map was the same one from last night, only it had the previous evening's pencil marks thickened with red lines.

"You have been awake long enough to improve it already," Harry said as he came through the doorway.

"I improved it all through the night," said Arthur. "You can improve your own courage and still call it practical. Same with maps. We have three new markers that are not where any map expects them to be."

Harry noticed his own hands still a little cramped from last night's return. "Who drew those?"

"Ron drew the route, Fred drew the warnings, and I drew the parts where nobody has drawn anything and still looked worried." Arthur took a sip, then added, "Come in. It should interest you if you still have nerve after the fog."

Ron was at the corner of the table, wrapped in a blanket and looking as if he had been awake since first light. He did not look up immediately.

"You look like a man who knows what he'll have for breakfast and doesn't approve of it in writing," Harry said.

Ron made a face that was almost a smile. "I had two and a half cups and three plans. That's enough."

Bill stood by the stair rail with a coat hanging from each elbow like two thoughts.

"I am not for this if it requires me to stand in a fog with a map and no chalk," he said quietly. "The wrongness has not gone away, Harry."

Harry had expected him to say that. It was the first time this week Bill had seemed to speak to the room and not to only Harry.

"Where are we going today?" said Molly as she entered, balancing two cups and a plate of toast with the seriousness of an emergency dispatch.

"Back to Fog Hollow," Arthur said, and this time even he sounded less certain than usual.

"Officially," added Molly, "we're not back to any Hollow that has the Weasleys arriving with a crowd and a black marker and a goat of a goose perched on a dock."

Harry laughed despite the heaviness in her face.

"We're not a mob," Ron said. "We're a family with a paper trail and three children who think stealth means misdirection."

Bill nodded at the map. "We're going to the Sourdough again. Not for a drink. For a witness who still has the nerve to be calm."

Arthur looked around the table. "And maybe for answers."

Molly put the toast down and leaned against the table. "Then you all eat first and speak second. I will not have decisions made on empty mouths."

Harry watched everyone gather the toast as if appetite and duty were inseparable. The room had never looked this deliberate, and he thought it a good sign. Danger rarely announced itself like that; it usually came in little polite increments, and people met it by making tea first.

---

At Sourdough the fog had thinned enough to show the lane's painted arrows and too much of the city pretending it had never been dangerous.

The bell did not ring when they came in. It clicked once and sighed like an old pipe. Gus was already behind the bar.

"You look like a council that did not get approval for its own conclusion," he said before any greeting was needed.

"Council in two hats and no biscuits still means committee meeting," said Arthur, stepping around to him.

"You brought the young one?" Gus asked, and his eyes were on Harry alone for one moment before turning back to everyone.

"We all brought him. He was useful already, and perhaps annoyingly awake," Arthur replied.

Gus gestured to the stools. "Sit. If you are going to bring seriousness into my kitchen, you may as well bring appetite."

Harry could tell from the way Gus moved that this was not just hospitality; it was a way of keeping panic from a chair and then not serving it too much tea.

Molly set down her shopping bag by the counter and smiled as if the whole place was an old friend and a complicated one.

"Tea first?" said Gus.

"Tea, then questions. Hard line now, I suppose," Arthur said, taking off his coat.

Gus nodded. "You are not the first man to talk like that after finding old stone that does not speak the language they promised it had learned."

The first half hour stayed at the level of warmth and food. Bread was passed. Someone joked about Arthur's fascination with every kettle valve, spoon design, and street sign. Marisol arrived near the door with damp curls tied back and a stack of folded slips in her fist.

"You've got all the right people here already," she said to Arthur as soon as she entered. "I brought that courier envelope from Mrs. Reyes."

She slid the envelope to Bill and gave no explanation to anyone else.

"You're early," Gus observed.

"No," said Arthur. "I'm late to whatever this is."

They waited for that to settle. Outside, fog pressed at the window in slow strokes.

"So, Arthur," said Gus, finally.

"Yes?"

"You asked me two days ago what I knew because I could not answer quickly in one sentence. Today we can do better."

Arthur folded his hands and nodded to Fred and George, who had followed close enough to pretend they were passing through for the joke but had stayed anyway.

"You know the BMA way?" Arthur asked.

"I have known many ways," said Gus. "I have stood in three ministries, two offices that called themselves bureaus, and two hundred rooms where people said they were protecting the city by building a wall around themselves."

Harry liked this because it sounded like Arthur and Gus were speaking fluent kinship.

"The ministry you mean?" Arthur said.

Gus gave him a long look that held humour and warning together. "The Bureau is not your Ministry. It is less ceremonial, more hungry. Less interested in saying nothing happened and more interested in knowing what happened, before the room burns."

"That sounds like you and me," Arthur said. "I have known an office that does both."

Gus chuckled, then took out two knives and tapped them against a wooden board. "Government service is a very neat marriage," he said. "On paper it is order. In practice it is children, forms, and one old man saying 'if we do not have the budget, we have no right to panic either.'"

Arthur shook his head. "I have sat in ministry rooms where panic arrived with two bells and no chairs."

Gus nodded at Molly. "And then they ask whether your mother called to say if the tea was boiled too hard. Family people are not better at government; they simply cannot ignore the house in between calls."

Arthur turned to Harry then to Bill. "I envy you. You can still do proper things and go home to children who call your name by volume."

Gus lowered his voice just enough to keep it private even in a room of five. "I left my wife in a quarter where nothing was ever simple. Eileen could fix wards for half an hour with one eye on the children and one hand on the stove. She made us both carry the same burden: if we keep the city safe by being invisible, who notices what we lose?"

Harry saw Arthur's shoulders still and stilling. He had used that look before with letters and lost things.

"She used to say a good rule breaks quietly?" Bill asked.

"She wrote it on her notebook the night before she died," Gus said. "Not because anyone was going to make it dramatic. She said, 'If a ward has a single point of pride, it will fail at the first honest question.'"

Arthur said quietly, "I remember that kind of sentence."

Gus nodded. "Eileen had a sharper one. 'You do not reinforce a line by shouting, you reinforce it by knowing which corner you stand in when the first mistake happens.'"

The kettle hissed. No one touched it.

"How far back?" asked Arthur.

"Further than your map reaches," said Gus. "The Alcatraz magical wing was designed in layers. No one line. No one office."

He lifted one hand and traced a rough circle on the air, then a smaller one within it.

"There was the first ring, built to hold people who needed certainty and no mercy. Then the second ring, made because the first was too proud. Then the transfer seam to channel resonance under water. That seam was what made the island useful when the war years were fresh and every problem in the world looked like it could be solved with louder magic."

"And now?"

"Now the seam still remembers where it is, even when every visible ward has gone quiet. It no longer hates everyone. It is patient. Patient is worse. Patient can be turned."

Harry had thought he knew wrongness as a pressure. He had not heard it described as patience.

"When did it go wrong?" Arthur said.

Gus took a sip and gave the first clear statement of the day. "I think we stopped asking it the question it was built to answer."

Bill leaned forward. "You mean maintenance."

"Maintenance, yes. But also memory. The wing was closed for normal use in sixty-three. Decommissioning never means forgetting. Eileen led part of the handover because she believed if the wing was emptied, the wards had to be taught new purpose. She designed a sequence that turned confinement into harmless lock-lattice after every tide."

"That was her idea?" said Arthur.

"Her idea, and ours because she made the rest of us look twice. She said people think decommission means 'turn it off.' She said it means 'take away fear's shape and leave function.'"

Harry pictured her: not beautiful in any dramatic way but sure enough with hands that had likely carried both bread and runes.

"Eileen finished the sequence," Gus continued. "Then she was given the worst part of all the old work: no applause and one day of rest. She had a chest infection the winter after the project. We buried her in the same week the city decided it no longer needed that wing. It gave me a small, ugly gift in grief: the city could move and still demand what we needed from those who had kept the city awake."

Arthur reached out and touched the side of Gus's mug. "I'm sorry."

"Thank you," said Gus. "People think silence is how we honour us. What she wanted was continuity."

The room had gone quieter than before they entered it.

Gus set his mug down. "I kept one copy of her sequence notes. Not all of it. Enough for a man who still hopes."

He reached under the counter and brought out a narrow tin case with wax seals. He placed it in the center of the table as if it weighed more than wood.

"For training, not panic," he said. "You have one line in this, and one warning."

Arthur opened his mouth with the reflex to joke and then seemed to decide not.

"How many people have you shown this to?"

"Enough to lose one name and keep one method," said Gus. "No one else needs it unless we face active movement."

Harry noticed Marisol watching in the doorway with an expression that said she heard one bell and two bells.

"You can call it 'official fear,' Gus," she said to him. "I brought the thing you wanted."

She handed Arthur a folded sheaf from her pocket. "This is the same sign pattern I saw yesterday, again and again. It matches the cart and the crate edge."

Gus took it and held it at an angle to the light.

"No one has ever admitted this is a symbol with a second life until you showed me it once by mistake in a stairwell." He held it for a breath. "It appears because somebody used the old seam as a route reference again. The old seam. Again."

Arthur's face went through the expression that meant he was no longer listening for jokes.

"Then this is not weather and not smuggling at all."

Bill said, "It's a corridor."

"It is a corridor with a heartbeat," Arthur said, sounding a little angry with himself for using words from Harry's line of speech. "Which means we need the people who can read heartbeat and map."

Marisol answered from the doorway. "That is why you have your visit now."

As if on cue, the bell gave a second voice, thinner than before. At the entrance stood a woman in a dark charcoal coat, hair pinned close at the neck, umbrella folded with military neatness.

"Tomoko Sato," she said to Gus, then to Arthur. "I'm not here for hospitality. I should have called, but this has moved past my calendar."

The name passed through the room and found a place to sit.

"You should not come into a private room without warning unless you have authority or tea in your hand," Arthur said gently.

"I can take either as soon as we're done," said Tomo. "I have neither."

"We're late enough for tea anyway," Gus said, deadpan.

She took the offered chair but kept her hands flat on the table and looked straight at Bill.

"You're William Weasley."

Bill nodded.

"You are not on the Fog Hollow open list. You have an interest in old wards connected to maritime infrastructure. That is not a problem if your work is transparent."

Bill held his expression. "And if it is not?"

"Then I ask you to stop telling stories to people on the waterfront before dawn."

Arthur raised one eyebrow. "Did you call us all for an interrogation?"

"I called to prevent one," Tomo replied. "There is a formal investigation into unregistered activity after the waterfront transfers. If we move badly, you become the noise and someone else becomes the target."

Gus made a small noise with the spoon.

Tomo nodded to him with respect and no smile. "You were already briefed, I assume."

"Briefed enough to know what you're trying to do by asking what we know before you tell us what you know," said Gus.

Tomo seemed to approve that.

"You know about the transfer seam signals and the cart routes."

"So we know you know exactly what we're talking about," Marisol said.

"Good."

Her tone did not soften. "And since I suspect you are not the source of the first anomaly, I'd like direct access to what you found."

Arthur moved to the map table on his own, as if he was inviting her to stand where everyone had been standing in every disagreement for years.

"Bill?"

Bill pulled a rolled sheet from under his coat and spread it open. It had the same symbols as Marisol's scrap and the pressure points they had marked from Alcatraz the day before.

"This is our composite. The symbols and the pressure points do not align with ordinary ward drift."

Tomo looked at it without blinking, eyes moving quickly but without rush.

"How many points are this month?"

"Three confirmed, two probable, one unconfirmed from the pier line," Bill said. "One more from the church finial route."

"Distances?"

"Approximate. Tidal and fog variance are severe."

"You used the term 'probable.' Good," Tomo said. She reached for a graphite pencil. "Mark confidence and timestamp."

Bill marked them in one movement.

"How do you test probable to probable?" Arthur asked.

"You keep each one as its own source until you can force a test," Tomo said. Her expression had not changed, but her voice did. "No dramatic wordplay. No assumption. This means your map becomes useful only if it behaves the same way every tide and under two observers."

Bill gave her a long look. "You sound like a professor and a station master."

"I am a ward specialist," she said. "Both are close."

Gus poured more tea and set cups near her as if he had been waiting all along for her to begin speaking in full sentences.

"You brought one copy of the sequence," Tomo said, tapping the tin case with two knuckles but not touching it.

Arthur lifted the case a little. "Not yet."

Tomo nodded, as if that made perfect sense. "Then tell me what you think its value is."

Bill set his jaw. "If it proves the corridor was intentionally rekeyed, it can tell us where the pressure line enters the service seam and where it exits into the harbor current."

"If you can prove that, this stops being a family rumor and starts being a BMA concern." She turned to Arthur. "I am here before the formal channel because we can either share, or we can wait for someone dead, and then all this becomes paperwork for an emergency."

"You are not wrong," Bill said.

"Then let's agree terms," said Tomo, and she placed both palms flat on the map. "I need witness logs, and I need your source dates. In return, you get access to the ward stack readings and corridor camera history for the last two tides."

Arthur looked as if he would ask for a legal clause.

"Who gets the first move?" he asked.

"We do not do moves. We do thresholds," she said. "Here is threshold one. If you can provide one verified source map with timestamp in the same hour window as the third transfer marker, I authorize a controlled escort for a tunnel-side walk."

Bill frowned. "Controlled by whom?"

"My team. You and your family stay out of the active seam path unless requested."

Gus leaned back and gave Arthur the look he used when someone finally understood a private joke.

"He means no heroics by grandmothers and children," said Gus.

Arthur's face broke into reluctant agreement. "There are no grandmothers in these plans."

Tomo said, almost dry, "That makes one problem less."

Bill's gaze returned to the map. "What's threshold two?"

"No independent investigations into sealed service entries after tonight. You share any visual clips now. You do not bring unvetted civilians to the first walk."

"That includes the twins," Arthur said, eyes flicking toward Fred and George.

They did not look up. Neither of them missed the note.

Tomo gave the brothers a quick and unreadable glance. "They are not children in this operation. That's the problem."

"Children are still children when they run faster than adults," Arthur said.

Tomo didn't argue. She only tilted the paper and wrote a narrow line beside the first cluster of symbols.

"Threshold three is yours," she added. "I can send you a full order if this stays clean. If it gets dirty, I cannot promise to protect reputation. I can promise only legal custody."

There was a pause as if everyone considered whether legal custody could be a kind of mercy.

Bill gave an uneasy laugh. "You think this sounds like you don't want to work with us."

Tomo met him with a flat answer. "I think I do not want to handle your family with your rules and then watch two children disappear."

Arthur nodded slowly. "Fair."

Gus lifted the tin case with two fingers and set it on the table between Bill and Tomo.

"Eileen's old sequence is not a weapon," he said. "It is a manual on how to shut what no one shuts any longer."

Tomo stared at it, then at Bill.

"You are asking me to rely on an old civilian sequence," she said. "Even with your verification, this is not enough for a written statement."

"It's enough for a warning," Bill said quietly. "And a warning is cheaper than evidence when time is short."

Tomo's mouth changed expression, almost a nod.

"All right. I will take it as a working reference."

Harry felt something in the room shift, as quietly as a latch being taken off by hand.

"Now," said Arthur, "if we are now all adults, can we maybe look at those unstable channels you mentioned and find out where the operation window sits?"

"I can show it." Tomo stood and took a chalk and pin from her case. "But if we do it at this table, it is theory. If we do it on a wall map, it is still theory. We need coordinates and tide pressure."

She moved to an empty table, set three sheets with a single line, and drew.

One curve for the old service corridor.
One for the waterfront ring.
One for the underlook feed line that no one wanted to admit because it did not behave like a corridor on maps.

She tapped the final point. "This is where your symbols land. Alcatraz service seam is not under Alcatraz all the time. It bleeds through this old drainage line at intervals."

Bill stepped beside her. "That's exactly what we saw in the warehouse tunnel ring from Marisol's signal."

Tomo looked at him briefly, and the room finally acknowledged the first professional exchange for real.

"You noticed the ring before the second tide?" she asked.

"At sea level the first ring was stable. Second was already failing. Third will not wait."

Bill kept one hand on the map.

Tomo nodded. "Then we do this fast."

Arthur and Gus remained by the table, and their hands stayed near each other without touching, a small shared habit of people used to carrying too much of the same kind of burden.

"Tomo," Arthur said, "you were in charge here last night?"

"No," she said. "I was assigned on paper. Not last night."

He nodded. "And you are still taking this personally."

"I am responsible to the city and to the people in it," she said. "That includes your children."

Arthur looked at him then at Bill and let the moment soften. "You have exactly our same fault," he said.

Gus took over, with the ease of someone stepping between two arguments. "Different countries, same fault. We all think if we do not stand in front of trouble, no one gets hurt. That is how trouble learns the room."

Tomo turned to him and smiled without softness. "I need you at the office door by noon, Mr. Ferreira, because I need one thing your records can give me tonight."

"You cannot ask and hope."

"Then ask properly."

Arthur laughed once, surprised. "This is the first time today I have seen a smile from BMA."

"That is because you kept the tea from getting cold," Gus said.

Bill and Tomo spoke for the next twenty minutes in a voice that was both technical and precise.

"If the seam is a pressure lock," Bill said, "we need to identify first-order anchors, not just visible distortion."

"Then give me your list of anchors. Distances."

"I have three from Alcatraz: one by service duct, one by stair ring, one by sealed wing door."

"Not enough," said Tomo. "You need the corridor count in the Underlook line too. Have you any reading on old drainage gates?"

"We have one from chapter six and one from chapter seven's dock line."

She made a note. "Then include both and mark confidence. You do not invent one number to make a neat shape."

"Neat shapes are for maps in books," Bill said.

"And for people who need comfort," she answered. "You have no comfort today."

Arthur gave him a little look as if to say yes.

She held up a sheet of paper. "The field office can authorize a limited access walk tomorrow just before dawn. Two minutes into the fog. If you decline, we close official support."

Bill considered. "Do we have to include Arthur?"

"Yes," said Tomo. "He can keep things in one place without making noise."

He nodded. "I can live with that."

"Do we keep the twins out?"

Arthur inhaled, as if he might disagree and still remain polite.

"No kids tonight," Tomo said. "I will not repeat that at two in the morning when they call for backup and one wand goes missing."

Molly's voice from behind the counter cut in: "You heard her."

She stepped in, carrying a plate of biscuits. "The first condition is yours, then. You are not permitted to frighten children as a method."

Tomo gave a brief nod and seemed to file that sentence away like a line that had once been important in another language.

"Then this is clear," said Bill. "Threshold list, in order: children stay out, timestamps shared, no independent entry, controlled first walk."

"And one more," Gus said.

"What?"

"If this is a city problem with children in danger, no one blames the city for being a city. You blame your own pride."

Tomo gave him a look that was almost gratitude. "I can draft that into plain terms if he needs it."

Arthur looked from Tomo to Gus and then to the table. "Plain terms, then. Tomo, we give you the evidence and we keep your terms. We expect what your office can give now."

Tomo held out her hand. Bill took it not as a handshake but as a test of intent. Their fingers met only briefly and without ceremony.

"I am not your ally yet," she said.

"Temporary alliances are still alliances," Bill replied.

Arthur laughed softly. "In government, temporary is how people survive."

Gus turned to him with that same dry affection. "In wardcraft, temporary means we build for permanent consequences."

The room seemed suddenly lighter.

"Show me the second part of the map now," Tomo said, and he moved to the table.

Bill and Tomo bent over it together. The tin case stayed where Gus had left it, and Marisol moved around the edge with the careful gait of someone who had learned to make room for power without making it grand.

They compared the symbols in pairs. The map looked less like ink and more like pressure.

Bill pointed to the line near the old service hatch. "This one was active only during fog and only if the water rose just so."

Tomo asked, "How did you verify without official instruments?"

"Because those instruments were not there last night," Bill said. "Because Harry felt the pressure and because the symbols were in the same places on the concrete."

"Harry's feeling is useful," said Tomo, surprising everyone. "But next we need proof."

"We can provide proof," Arthur said. "Not if we are all going to be arrested for being wrong."

"Being wrong is expensive, but being unprepared is worse," she said. "You have until tonight."

Bill spread two hands. "Then we give you a practical file: the frames, the map, witness times, and the symbol timing."

Tomo nodded. "Good. In exchange, we send a tunnel watch log and the ward stack from under the underlook mouth. If it confirms your corridor map, we move to controlled access. Not before."

Gus gave Harry a look that said no theatrics.

At that moment Arthur seemed younger and older both.

"You do not know yet," he said, "how much I trust this."

Bill answered from the table. "Then trust the work."

Gus lifted the tin case and closed it with his thumb. "He said in his life that is the right answer to most storms: trust the work, not the mood."

Tomo stood. "You have until noon to deliver the file. My office after that if you decide this is useful."

Arthur glanced toward the door and then at the crowd of his family gathered in the room. "Useful is not your word and ours."

"No," Tomo said. "Not useful. Necessary."

She moved to the coat rack.

Harry watched her pause at the threshold. "You don't have to come into this at all, Mr Weasley. But you are in it."

She gave him a look that did not soften. "So is everyone in this city. That is why you learn where to draw the line."

She left with the wind of her coat and the quick click of boots. The door settled. No one moved immediately.

Arthur remained seated, then reached for his cup.

"Morning now, but it feels like a court hearing," he said.

Molly put down the plate and gave him exactly what he needed to be heard. "Then drink your tea first and talk after. Court still waits for full sentences."

Gus leaned on the counter and looked out the window, where fog took no side in any office argument.

"He is right," Bill said. "Tonight we move toward a controlled walk. And if we can keep this civil, we keep families whole."

Arthur gave him that look of fatherly pride. "You had to be the one to say that."

Gus smiled in the corner of his mouth. "My wife would have approved if she could still see over this table."

Harry saw Arthur's hand reach for the folded map and then for the tin case. The two things together looked as if they might hold a city's weight. Neither of them did. But they held a beginning.

Outside the fog lifted and then refused again, like a curtain deciding when to close.

Molly stepped closer to Harry and tucked the plate into his hand. "You have biscuits. Sit. People are making plans and pretending they can keep out of danger."

He took one biscuit and felt the taste of sugar and salt and burnt edges.

"It doesn't scare me," he said, surprising himself because he wasn't sure if it was true.

"Why not?" she asked.

Harry kept his eyes on the map on the table, where Arthur and Bill had already begun to draw a second line in darker ink.

"Because last night I was a kid in the fog," he said. "Today I'm expected to be part of a team."

From the door, Marisol called out, "Arthur, Bill, Gus — if anyone's coming for your channel, he won't use the weather. He'll use time."

Arthur nodded. "Then we map by the time."

Bill held up the second sheet, the one with the unstable channels.

"From here," he said, tapping the center where the symbols sat, "it is no longer rumor."

Gus looked at that point and then at Arthur.

"No, it's not rumor at all," he said. "It is your city's second chance."

Harry leaned over the map and found his own eyes catching the thin line that connected the waterfront ring to the old service seam, then to the underlook mouth.

The wrongness had returned, not as panic and not as certainty, but as an appointment.

And with it, the strange relief that came when a problem finally had names, signatures, and a timetable with people willing to sit at the same table until they did something with it.
