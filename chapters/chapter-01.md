# Chapter 1 — Harry finds home in transit

Aunt Petunia had a talent for making July mornings feel like a punishment. The heat had not properly settled in yet, and yet the narrow kitchen by the window was already warm from the electric heat and from the way she kept things shut up and hot even when the rest of the house wanted to breathe. From the bottom of the cupboard where Harry had made himself tiny for years, he could hear the whine of the toaster, the click of the clock in the hall, and his aunt’s voice carrying through the wall with its usual bright varnish.

“Dudley, you will not leave that jar open,” she was saying. “If you had any self-respect at all you would have taken it to the sink before breakfast. You’re setting a bad example for your friends.”

“I’m trying, Mum.”

“Trying,” Dudley mimicked, stretching, and the whole house answered with furniture-shifting sounds.

Harry stayed still on the landing of the cupboard stair. He had long ago learned the shape of his mornings in the Dursleys’ house: if he moved early, they might notice only his broom, if he stayed still they might not notice him at all. He had learned to be quiet when the clock sounded like authority, to watch the door gaps for shadows, to count voices and pretend they were weather.

He pressed the heel of his hand against his cheek and tried not to think about the fact that for all summer no one had touched his shoulder except to push him out of the way. In July there were always errands and calls, and if there were any moments of kindness they came wrapped around a correction. He had no appetite for toast, but he had appetite for every single minute that might be different from this.

The first sound that did not belong to the house came from the front hall below, and it came with a cheerful, entirely un-dursleyish rhythm.

Three polite taps.

Then, as if someone had accidentally coughed into their gloves, there was a scrape and the sound of paper against paper.

Harry froze, breath caught in his throat. He knew that old rhythm. Aunt Petunia would have known too, if she had the slightest imagination.

There was no spell recognition charm. No bright light. Just the clean click of someone opening a door by a knock that was too old-fashioned for this age and too proper to be for a neighbour bringing a pie.

Dudley’s voice came down the stairs. “What is it now?”

Another voice from the hall, older and warm and cheerful in a way that made Harry aware of every muscle in his shoulders. “Good morning! Sorry to arrive so abruptly. Arthur Weasley and family are here for Harry, if this is still the right address.”

There was a pause in which Harry could almost hear Aunt Petunia measuring every syllable she had to say to remain correct. “This is the house.”

The door opened. Then another voice, older, breathless, unmistakably female, with a tone that carried laughter and command in equal proportions, cut in. “I’m sorry to barge in on the breakfast hour, but we had best begin before the sun fully rises, did you hear? The Portkey window closes in six minutes from noon, I think.”

Molly Weasley.

Harry did not see her yet, but he could taste salt in the air of the open hallway, and in that fraction of a second his body remembered what that meant: welcome, noise, the possibility of being one of a crowd instead of an object.

He should have moved by the staircase at once, because for all his years he could still feel the rules: guests of the Dursleys stayed in the kitchen while he waited in the hall for permission. He stayed where he was, half-hidden by the stair rail as he had practiced. That was still the safe thing.

“Could we please have him now?” said Arthur’s voice, not sharp with command, only with patient urgency.

“You can come in,” Aunt Petunia said. “He is in no shape for nonsense.”

“Good,” said Arthur. “Nonsense is exactly what we’ve all been through this year.”

The door banged and footsteps approached. Harry knew he had one heartbeat in which to remain invisible and one heartbeat in which he was no longer allowed that luxury.

Aunt Petunia appeared, not at the top of the stairs, but at the corner where she could avoid looking directly at him. “There you are, Potter. Take your coat. Molly, do keep an eye on him. He has no sense with strangers.”

The sentence was not a question. It was the old line that had accompanied him like a bell.

Molly’s laugh came down the hall, soft and genuine. “Mum, we have brought two spare overcoats, a blanket, a tea set, and enough tea cakes to bribe all of you into peace.”

And before Harry had even stepped out, there was movement, another door, and a tall figure with red hair and kind eyes blocked the light from the stairwell behind him.

“Harry,” Ron called.

“Harry? You can call me anything from now on except not now, as in too-late,” said Fred in a stage whisper.

“Rory can’t stop saying he’d like that,” said George, as if there were no such thing as morning.

Ron stood with his hands at his sides the way he did when he was trying to look older than he felt. He had his hair tucked behind his ear and a smile that looked uncertain in the mirror of fear and relief.

Harry blinked. Then he did what he always did when his thoughts leapt ahead: he swallowed and stepped down.

He had one breath where he could still be the ugly cupboard boy. He used it.

Then Aunt Petunia was there with a smile so small it scarcely moved and a list of instructions still to come. “No one is to call him Harry outside. He’ll get his attention at odd times. He’s very... sensitive.”

Ron’s face changed. He looked at his mother, then at Arthur, then at Harry, and gave the smallest nod. “Right.”

Arthur stepped forward and said, “Right. We shall avoid shouting.”

The joke landed badly because it was kind, and Harry gave the first genuine laugh he had managed in a year. The old manila bag Ron was carrying slipped, and George caught it and set it down with a bow as if they were entering a theatre.

“Please don’t make that face,” said Molly, who had entered in one rush and was already untying the straps from her satchel. “That’s not a face at all, that’s weather.”

The phrase had been one Harry had never heard from any adult in the Dursley house, and it did something to him that was almost painful.

Aunt Petunia had already gone back toward the kitchen, speaking to the wall in the old tones of ownership. “The board game and the newspaper. Don’t touch either on the way out.”

Harry felt no compulsion to pick up his possessions. His own possessions were mostly a sweater and a pair of shoes and a knife he had never used and did not know how to keep. He looked at those things for a second, then over at Ron, waiting with a hand held out awkwardly like a rope.

Arthur had already moved to the side to let the Dursleys keep their distance, and in that small choreography Harry saw what he had needed to see all summer: he was not a guest nobody could place, not a warning to be managed. He was the boy at the centre of two dozen practical hands.

“Ready?” asked Molly.

Harry nodded.

At the front gate they did not linger long enough for goodbyes. Vernon's voice came from the front room behind them, deep and formal.

“Don’t forget him if you forget your manners.”

Unspoken in the tone was less instruction and more accusation.

Harry did not look back.

By the time they reached the road, the Dursleys were as far away from him as the cold cup of tea left on a sill. He had never before noticed that the summer air could smell clean when he was not expecting dust and soap and cabbage.

An old-fashioned blue van was waiting, and its windows were filled with folded maps, a thermos bag, and the corner of a blue woollen scarf that might have belonged to Molly at some point and now looked like a flag of surrender.

“Arthur, is that yours?” Harry asked, trying not to sound absurd.

“Strictly speaking, it belongs to the ministry route office,” Arthur said with a chuckle. “Today it belongs to us.”

Molly had already directed Fred and George into the back where there was room for two suitcases, a box of what might have been jam and actually was a wand-repair kit, and Ron’s careful folder of itinerary printouts.

“I brought maps,” Percy said, appearing at once with two sheaves. He was still in his first serious adult sweater, collar too high for the day, and the expression of someone who would rather have everything alphabetised.

“Wonderful,” said Arthur. “Now if I could only find socks to match the map colors.”

Dudley’s shout followed from somewhere behind the gate as if from underwater. “Don’t let him steal your wand!”

None of the family reacted except Fred, who tilted his head and asked, “Should we be worried?”

“Only if he has one,” said George.

Harry smiled in spite of himself.

The van drove through streets that seemed to know where they were going, and by the time it reached the station road Harry felt his knees loosen. He had expected the trip to America to be announced in grander terms—planes and passports and a line of men with clipboards at the airport. Instead there were six people in a van, two of whom looked like they would rather be arguing over marmalade than over border procedures, and one of whom—Molly—was already calculating what to feed whoever had developed the bad habit of skipping breakfast.

He was not ungrateful, but his life had trained him in irony.

At the station, Arthur led them into a waiting room with no sign of enchantments and one very ordinary clock. At once he lifted his bag and drew from it a brass hand mirror with little scratches along the edge.

“That’s not for vanity,” said Molly when Harry glanced at it. “This is our key.”

Arthur gave the mirror a little tap with two fingers and then another, in a rhythm so quick it looked like a nervous habit and nothing else.

“Portkey window?” Harry asked.

“Yes,” said Arthur, turning to him with what might have been apology. “The window’s open for exactly one hour this morning under Ministry route clearance. We’ve only got time to do this right.”

Molly knelt and placed a small, warm hand on Harry’s shoulder. “We’re taking you straight to the other side. We’re not stopping in the States first, because if I’d known we had a full day for airports, Percy would have written a chart for it. We can’t risk being delayed between jurisdictions.”

Harry swallowed another question. “So you brought me all this way by a Portkey?”

“A very official, heavily documented, absolutely legal and slightly uncomfortable one,” said Percy, holding up one paper and making a face at it. “The route goes via London and a controlled transatlantic waypoint. There’s legal language.”

“Does it hurt?” George asked.

“It’s like being pushed hard from one side into a wave, then dragged sideways, if that’s any use,” Arthur said. “You either hold one hand and look where you’re going, or you look at the sky and have your insides ask questions.”

“Excellent,” said Percy. “Wonderful metaphor.”

“Tell me again not to look at the sky,” said Arthur.

“No promises,” said Harry.

He felt absurdly amused. Even now, he was being folded into a family’s private language. A sentence with his own edge of danger in it and somebody else’s laugh to soften it.

The mirror went warm in Arthur’s hand and then cold. He set it down on the edge of the station bench and looked back at each person.

“Hold hands if you can,” Arthur said, not because he needed instructions, but because he knew if he said nothing, someone would try an idiot jump into a pocket of cloud.

“Ron?” asked Molly, “take your brother’s left side.”

“Left side?” Harry repeated.

Ron nodded with as much formality as he could. “I’ll be left.”

“Good,” said Arthur. “George and Fred, second chain. Percy, legal documents and emergency biscuits. Bill, Molly’s satchel.”

Bill was there—of course there. Hair that had gone sun-bright from the journey, posture easy and too composed for his age. He gave Harry a short nod, then held up both hands and moved forward.

“You don’t have to do this,” said Harry.

Bill’s expression softened. “You do,” he said. “No one does rescue by halves.”

The last person to join was Molly, and she looked around once, checking everyone was where they belonged. Then she stepped backward to set the mirror between them and said, almost to herself, “And now no one gets ideas about touching what is not theirs.”

Harry heard the little metallic cough, not loud but very real, and the world answered.

The station floor vanished.

He felt no drop and no lift. There was no flight or tunnel; there was a long clean line of silver through the dark, as if someone had drawn a stroke through every noise he had ever known and then drawn it thinner, until it hummed. The handrail vanished. The train’s windows dissolved into stars, and a new cold entered his breath, the clean cold of moving too quickly between spaces that had no names.

He grabbed Ron’s sleeve without thinking.

Somewhere in him there was a bright panic that did not belong to danger but to too much becoming true at once.

Then, for a second, his nose filled with something green and wet, like cut seaweed and soap, and he thought of nothing except distance.

The next instant, they were all in motion again but not on any road he could see. The station, the queue, the platform clock were gone. In their place was a rush of white that tasted like mint. He heard Fred whisper near him, “If you hear a horn, we’ve gone to church. Ignore me.”

He did what Harry had spent three years learning to do in a world full of surprises: he held still while his mind ran.

The silver line widened. It became a lane of ordinary air with fog beyond it. The ground came back in hard angles and old stone edges.

When his feet found earth again, he was standing on rough wooden decking under an arch painted with black letters and bright red trim. Around him, gulls wheeled as if they had been waiting for this moment.

Arthur put one hand on his shoulder. “Welcome to the other side,” he said, and he said it so quietly it did not carry pride. “You did magnificently, Harry. You can still be dizzy. Keep breathing.”

He nodded, suddenly too aware of his pulse.

A woman with a small, kind face and a navy coat held a sign that said nothing in plain sight. No word of his name. No luggage arrows. Just a red scalloped border. She had no more reaction to magical transfer than a London bus driver to a wet sock.

“There’ll be no customs if one ignores magic.”

“She says no one can stand still this early and call it luck,” said Bill.

He had no idea what she meant and was too relieved she had spoken to think about it. The fog rolled around their ankles and then away, revealing broad harbour water and the sharp, clean smell of it.

“Is this—?” Harry asked.

“This is the other end,” said Arthur, looking up at a distant shape that rose like stone against the fog. “San Francisco.”

For years that name had lived in the margins of a map in his head, with little notes in his own childish handwriting, mostly names of places he had never seen. He remembered the one thing the wizarding world always did with America: talked. About muggles. About systems. About distance. About who had gone there and who had disappeared.

Now he stood in fog with six adults and two brothers and four children around him, each one already making jokes to keep the moment from becoming a wound.

“What happened to planes?” George asked.

“Planes make less romantic memories,” said Arthur.

“Planes make predictable arrivals and better snacks,” said George.

“Snacks come from Arthur,” said Fred.

“Don’t start before noon,” said Molly and her voice cut through like cinnamon in flour. “You all will get tired and forget to unpack.”

Molly reached into the bag at her feet and produced two paper napkins, a jar, and a biscuit tin with a cloth tied around the top. “You all eat first. We have not eaten since dawn and we are not discussing the transatlantic mystery until after six biscuits each.”

Ron made a face and said, “Mum, we are in a foreign country. Can we wait?”

She fixed him with a look that was both apology and command. “No.”

Aunt Petunia had always made meals feel like an inspection. Here Molly made food feel like weather, something unavoidable and merciful. Harry had not yet put a biscuit in his mouth.

Arthur saw it and said, to his own surprise perhaps, “Food first, questions second.”

“Now that’s not nonsense,” said Harry.

The ferric smell of harbour and the rust smell of old pilings and the hum of the city all at once made him uncertain about what to do with his hands.

He had expected this trip to begin with his own confusion. He had not expected it to begin with someone insisting he eat.

As they moved inland through streets that seemed somehow both old and restless, Harry looked from face to face and tried to fit each person into a new place in his world.

Bill and Percy, clearly, had their own map of routes and times. Molly counted people and pockets and parcels in three different systems. Fred and George saw opportunities for mischief in every sign and every shadow, and Ron saw, as always, his mouth before him and his chest before his voice.

Arthur walked with his head tilted at every doorway and fire hydrant, as if each American invention had personally insulted him and he intended to forgive it in private.

“Do muggles use these for decoration?” he asked of one hydrant.

“It’s not decoration,” said Harry, unable to stop himself from stepping in. “It sprays water in emergencies.”

Arthur stopped. “Emergency? That’s what it’s called? That’s the title?”

“An emergency water outlet,” George said.

Molly snorted. “Arthur, we are crossing an ocean and you have already found three emergencies.”

Ron gave him a look that was half admiration and half despair.

By the time they reached the Haight-Ashbury streets and the lane that narrowed toward their rented house, Harry had begun to see how the city could be loud and still private. The buildings were shoulder-high with old paint, narrow windows, faded signs, tiny trees climbing over roofs. The air tasted like wet wood and coffee. Above them, fog pressed flat, then lifted, then returned as if indecisive.

And then the house came into view.

It was a pale blue rectangle pretending it had once known better days, and pretending no one had seen it struggle in recent weather. The trim around the windows looked as if someone had done their best with a chisel and too many years ago. There was a porch with one cracked step, and a narrow strip of backyard where a lemon tree stood at a slight angle, leafless in places but stubbornly alive.

Molly stopped at the gate and put both hands on the railing as if greeting a person.

“I do know this is a rented place,” she said, and to her own surprise her voice wavered very slightly, “but if it had a say, it would call itself a home.”

Inside, the door opened into a hallway where shoes lined one wall and coats another. The kitchen was immediately visible from the front, and the first thing Harry noticed was not the furniture but the way everything looked handled.

Not overdone. Not perfect.

Useful. A house with lived-in rules.

Ron gave him a look over his shoulder, and for the first time since boarding the Portkey, Harry believed he saw relief in his brother’s face. “You can leave your shoes anywhere,” Ron said quickly, then added, “No, not anywhere. Near the rug. Not the rug.”

Molly was already in motion.

“Arthur, put his bag here. No, not that one—there’s a damp line. Fred, George, stop trying the doorknob three times. Bill, where did you keep the tea? Percy, if you have made three copies of the itinerary, make one for the kitchen and tear it up.”

Fred and George stared, took in the command chain, then each did the opposite and then the right thing.

Harry stood in the hallway with his bag still in hand and suddenly remembered where he had expected to be that day: a spare room with peeling wallpaper and a cupboard smell in every corner, where kindness came in warnings.

This was not warning. This was all noise and urgency and practical concern.

Molly moved to him then. “Oh, there you are,” she said with a tenderness so plain it hurt. “You look exactly like you’ve crossed three seas and nobody has fed you. Come on, Harry, sit. No, not for questions. For hot tea.”

She did not ask whether he would. She knew.

Harry dropped his bag in the hall and sat at the table because no sentence had ever done more work than her hand around his wrist and the command in it.

At the table sat two bread rolls, a bowl of thick porridge with cinnamon, something that looked like scrambled eggs but better, and a plate of toasted oats with sliced bananas because she had, clearly, done this many times on trains and in emergency weather. Someone had thought through whether a boy needed food at all hours, and had done so with an intelligence no one praised and no one noticed in his old life.

“Take this,” she said, handing him a plate. “And more. You don’t speak until your mouth is full if this keeps happening.”

He laughed then, with that thin, careful laugh no one noticed as much as it should have. He took the food.

“Do we have a place for him?” Fred asked.

Molly gave him a look over the bowl and said, “We have a room, Fred. Not a place.”

“Difference?” Ron asked.

“Place is where he goes to sleep,” said Molly. “A room has rules.”

Arthur, passing behind them, shook his head. “We have rules for mugs and windows and everything but not for this matter.”

“Then we do now,” said Molly.

“Does it include him?” Harry asked.

“Of course,” she said. Not because she was performing kindness, but because she had never seen kindness as a thing to perform.

The children laughed. Fred gave him his best salute with one spoon and whispered, “Welcome, brother. Keep your eyes open and your wand where your hand can find it.”

“Is there one,” Harry asked.

George answered before Fred could, solemnly. “Not tonight, not here. We’re all going to find it first.”

In ordinary families, that would have been a joke at someone’s expense. In this one, it was a sentence about safety.

After tea, there was the business of unloading. Harry helped carry a tin trunk up two narrow flights of stairs. The first landing had three umbrellas and two hats. The second had a narrow window looking onto the side yard. The stair well smelled faintly of lemon oil and floor polish.

“You’re sure we’re not in the habit of collecting dust and dust bunnies in this house?” Harry asked.

Molly answered from above, “Only if they’re paying rent.”

He carried the trunk into a room that had two unoccupied bunks and shelves lined with old books no one had yet chosen to own. The wallpaper was plain and cheerful enough to seem brave.

Ron had moved ahead and opened a closet to hang coats. “You can use this bed,” he said, gesturing to the right-hand one. “Or that one. No one owns it. We rotate.”

Harry stood in the doorway and felt the air change. Dumbledore never told him this would be the moment. It felt less like escape and more like permission.

Ron shifted as if surprised by his own voice. “Sorry. I mean—sorry if this is too much. It’s... just here.”

“Thanks,” Harry said.

He did not trust the word, he was afraid of saying it too fully, the way it could break something.

Molly knocked on the frame. “That’s enough. Leave his room and come down. I’m making more tea.”

Downstairs, the whole family had already become a living mechanism around themselves. Fred and George had discovered an unstable drawer in the kitchen that refused to close unless it was struck at the right angle. Arthur stood by a lamp on the counter, peering through it as though it were an instrument.

“It’s beautiful,” he said to Molly, lifting the lamp off the table and turning it so the shade gave off light in a different direction. “In this country they make things for brightness and not for survival, and that is to say, they are less clever than we are.”

“You’ve already made it practical,” said Molly. “Now keep your hands off the switch.”

“Can I keep it?” Fred asked. “We can’t let you ruin it with your experiments, we can only preserve the old one.”

“Why don’t you open that drawer and ask it politely to stop,” said Arthur.

“No,” said Fred, “it has no manners.”

Ron muttered, “Like some adults.”

The room shook once with laughter, and if Harry listened hard, he could hear the laugh line through the house in old rhythm: no one waiting for permission, everyone making room.

He felt something unclench in him and then reknit in a new way.


Arthur leaned against the bannister and held out his hand to Harry. “Come with me and see this place from the upstairs,” he said.

Together they walked through the short hall and stopped at the narrow back staircase. At the top was a little landing where there were two boxes of books and a shelf of old tins. The wall was bare except for a small, crooked nail and a line of string that had once held holiday photos.

“I had this place from a cousin of yours and his cousin and their cousin,” Arthur said. “There are always cousins in the background. You’re here now, so we can all pretend we are family with less blood and more effort.”

Harry could not remember whether he found the corner funny or unbearable. He settled for saying, “Thank you.”

“You don’t need to say it yet,” Arthur said. “You can start with tea and bed.”

Molly’s voice floated up from below. “If you’re both still up there, do not invent stories about this house and no one can stop you until seven.”

Arthur smiled. “She says this in case you are inventing nonsense.”

The evening had a particular texture in that house—one of small instructions layered over larger comfort. At exactly the wrong moment, there was power cut flicker and then a faint, soft hum from the cupboard under the landing stairs. Harry stood very still. The hum came and went once, like someone tapping the back of his knee.

Then he heard it again.

Not a sound exactly. A wrongness, like a note where no key existed.

He looked at Arthur, who had also paused. Arthur’s face changed by the width of a feather.

“What is that?” Harry asked quietly.

Arthur raised a hand as if asking for caution from a stranger in another room. “Mmm. Could be one of the extension closets settling.”

“Might be,” said Arthur, then added after a second, “or damp in the walls.”

He bent toward the closet door at the base of the stair and touched the carved strip with his fingernail. A second later he withdrew it.

“Only a second runescope,” he said, though he did not step away.

Harry thought of old stories of cursed basements and hidden corridors and dark places in walls. He thought of the Dursleys’ cupboard and the smell of locked cupboards and the old magic that had no place to go.

“What exactly is it?” Harry asked again.

“Nothing to panic over yet,” Arthur said. “I am not asking you to panic. I’m asking you to remember the shape of it and tell me if you feel the same in the morning.”

“Tomorrow,” Arthur said, turning the strip with care, “before tea.”

Harry nodded. He tried to breathe, and the hum disappeared.

Molly’s voice from the stairs called, “If you’re making the air dramatic, do it after tea.”

Arthur grinned. “We live by her decree.”

Upstairs, Ron already had one sock in the wrong drawer and two chairs drawn into the room as if that might help him appear awake. He had not yet learned how to make this house fit him; Harry did not either. But there was no malice in either confusion.

“Come in,” Ron said. “You can have this bed. I can do the floor if I pretend it’s strategy.”

The room had two beds close enough to be a conspiracy and far enough for both egos. The window looked onto a yard where the lemon tree leaned toward the street and the fog had moved around it like breath.

Harry held the towel for a second and felt his eyes prick. He had not planned on tears and had no right, yet here it came at the edges.

No one made a fuss. No one noticed if they did not have to.

After a quick wash and a hand over his face, Harry lay down fully clothed in the narrow bed. The room still had voices from the kitchen, but they were a warm, distant machinery, not the clipped, corrective sounds of the Dursleys. He had to force himself to understand that this noise was not warning.

It was home.

Not the word he had used before, not in this life. But close enough to become real.

He drifted in and out near midnight, each time waking with a small, strange fear that he was going to open his eyes to find the old house and the smell of cabbage and the locked cupboard. Each time he did wake, he heard no order from Aunt Petunia, no key in a lock, only Fred’s muffled laugh from the room next door and the sound of Arthur’s low footsteps in the kitchen, as if checking pipes and windows and everybody at once.

At some point, between two thin breaths of sleep, he became aware of the same hum again.

It came from lower down the stairs, behind the landing, from the closet they had touched earlier. Soft as a held tone. Not a danger. Not comfort.

Harry sat up, heart hard enough to be seen.

In the dim light the house seemed full of sleeping bodies and the faintest amber of a lamp at the end of the hall. He stayed still for a moment, listening, and then, very carefully, he rose and crossed to the landing.

He did not turn on the light.

From the stairwell landing, he could see where the closet door stood partly open, enough that a line of warmer air crossed the floor. He stepped to it and put two fingers on the edge. No heat. No alarm. Just a faint vibration in the timber, as if the house had learned a secret in old weather and was trying to tell no one.

“Rational first,” he whispered to himself.

The thought felt like a spell against panic.

He touched the floor near the base where the blue stripe ran. The hair on his arms rose, not cold, not hot, exactly wrong.

He did not call. He did not wake the family yet. Instead he closed the door with a careful hand and went back down the stairs.

At the bottom, he noticed for a long time a small shelf where Molly had lined up spoons by size. A spoon did not belong to this world if you took it too seriously.

Back in the hallway, he stood where the light from the kitchen spilled around the edges, and he let himself breathe like any other person trying to be ordinary.

The hum had moved on. The house did not feel threatening.

He looked toward the staircase where Ron’s room door stood ajar.

“Harry?” came a sleepy whisper.

He turned, and Ron peered out in his shirt sleeves, hair wild. “You awake?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” Harry said.

“Me too.”

“Just wrongness,” said Harry. “I’ll tell Molly in the morning.”

Ron nodded like he understood too much to say. “Goodnight then.”

“Goodnight.”

Harry went back to the bed and lay down again. In his mind, the first day passed again: the station, the silver line, the fog at the water, the pale blue house, Molly’s hand on a plate, Arthur’s patient instructions, the boys’ noise like weather they could not help.

This was not the life he had expected. He did not expect to be expected.

Not long after, he heard the house settle, and the last thing he thought before sleep took him was that expectation might have been the thing keeping him alive.

He was in a new place, with people who did not ask him to be small. He still heard the hum. The hum did not frighten him yet.

It marked a seam.

The seam was small, and he knew enough now to notice seams before the seam split open.

Tomorrow, he would tell Molly exactly what happened. Tomorrow, he would learn where the closet should have stayed silent.

For tonight, he let the house keep him.
