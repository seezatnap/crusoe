# Chapter 7 - Fog Hollow Night Watch

The house was asleep by the time Fred knocked on Harry’s door with the conspirator’s rhythm of two taps, one pause, one tap. It was the same rhythm he used at Christmas when he had smuggled a singing teapot into the Great Hall, and whenever Fred used it, it meant one of two things: either a prank had already happened, or a prank about to happen had already become a plan and needed witnesses for accountability.

Harry opened his eyes without opening his mouth. It was not really midnight yet. On fog-heavy nights in San Francisco, midnight looked like the idea of midnight, a little early and not yet convinced of itself.

He could hear George in the hall, already whispering as if they were in the Forbidden Forest. “He’s still awake, isn’t he? If he’s not, we can wake him by accident and still call it tactical.”

“Is this about snacks?” Harry said, pushing himself up.

“No,” Fred said.

“Never,” George said.

“Then one of you should leave and we can think this over again,” Harry said, reaching for his robe. “I slept all afternoon because someone said we were all going to stay up and inspect gulls.”

“Exactly,” said Fred. “That was plan A. Plan B is inspect something much less feathered.”

Harry rubbed his eyes and crossed to the door. A draft came in, carrying fog in. Fred and George had done a very good job in dressing for mischief: black jumpers, one too long by half an inch, one cap pulled low, both with faces set as if they had swallowed candlelight.

“At least one of you can blink,” Harry said.

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred.

Marisol appeared from the back of the hall, sleeves rolled, scarf tied close to her mouth against the wet. She held a folded, damp map over one shoulder and a small, practical satchel in her other hand.

“The route is clear?” Harry asked.

“Clear for now,” Marisol said. “Fog Hollow has no moon tonight, but it has moonlight from every streetlamp that forgot to work properly. Which means every wrong man can hide.”

“Perfect,” said George.

Harry had learned, not from them but from being around them, that the twins never liked the word perfect unless it was attached to disaster. It meant, in their lexicon, *interesting.*

“Why me?” he asked.

Fred spread his hands. “You’re not just a witness. You’re the only one here with enough nerves to call this what it is.”

“No one called me at this hour to compliment my nerves,” Harry muttered.

“You’re going to get better sleep in a week if you sleep now,” George said. “This is going out before the night gets smug. If that’s a problem, there are two kinds of solutions. Either we do without you and come back with less dignity, or we do it with you and come back with less dignity but more facts.”

Marisol looked at Harry as if he were already half-in and half-out of the room.

“Pick your species of dignity,” she said. “The rats have no patience for it.”

Harry laughed despite himself. “I see this is a rescue mission from the Department of Ridiculous.”

Fred nodded gravely. “Not rescue. Reconnaissance. By Committee.”

Ron’s head appeared briefly at the end of the hall, barefoot and carrying a narrow black case that had been repaired so many times it looked like a puzzle. He had that face Harry recognized as Ron’s *I knew this was coming and now here we are* expression.

“You leaving,” Ron said.

“Are we late?” Harry asked.

“Not yet,” Ron said. He stepped in, holding out two narrow objects from inside the case. They were tiny copper radios, matte black with cloth-wrapped leads.

“Two-way with short range,” Ron said. “A lot simpler than we have in the house. One for Fred, one for Marisol.” He handed one to George and then to Marisol. “The third stays with me.” He turned to Harry and slid the second radio into his hand. “I’ll be in the old lookout above the rear porch. Keep voices low, and if you hear two clicks and one buzz from this, that means immediate retreat. If you hear one long buzz, that means you can move again.”

George grinned at him. “You sound like every map you’ve ever made.”

“It’s because every good map starts with discipline,” Ron said. Then, more quietly, to Harry alone: “If there’s a bad pulse, if you feel that pressure right where the old maps failed, come straight back and do not improvise. You’re not trying to prove anything to me. You’re trying not to disappear.”

“Trust me,” Harry said.

Ron gave him a look as if that was precisely the point. “Tonight you can’t trust anything, including me. So check.”

That was as much affection as warning. Harry slid the radio into his pocket and nodded.

They moved out through the back door in a line so short and careful it felt like a sentence spoken too quickly. The house swallowed its light behind them, leaving only the blue of the hallway and the sound of one kettle settling somewhere distant.

Outside, the fog had settled over Fog Hollow like a patient, damp animal. It moved slowly, not enough to hurry and not enough to permit mistakes. Every lamp at the corner glowed as a small, enclosed moon.

The street looked ordinary in one respect: too ordinary. It was the ordinary of old buildings close enough together that windows faced each other as if listening, and wet cobbles that held old salt and old arguments. Above, the city was no longer visible, only a few rooftops and one church spire hidden behind wool.

Fred led them down the side lane to the old fishermen’s row, where the air always tasted faintly of iron and diesel. In daylight the place looked tired; at night it felt like it remembered the tide and pretended not to.

George had a small satchel in one hand and a tube of spray in the other. Harry saw at once the tube was lime paint, and a strip of black electrical tape was wound around his wrist.

“You always carry tape?” Harry asked.

“Useful for improvising dignity,” George said.

They turned a corner and came into a lane where old weatherproof signs leaned like broken ribs against the wall.

“It’s the old cargo lot?” Harry asked.

“No,” Marisol said. “The lane that leads to one of the back docks. The only part where the city still uses the same keys it used thirty years ago.”

“Meaning we have no locks and no owners,” Fred said. “Meaning we are not alone.”

“Meaning we are early,” Marisol said.

They passed under a striped awning. On one corner someone had pinned a faded paper sign announcing fresh crabs and discount stew. Below it, three boys stood with one broken bicycle and a flask of cheap cider.

Marisol paused. “This is where we do it.”

“What exactly?” Harry asked.

Fred reached into a pocket and pulled out a small packet of blue chalk and a tiny bottle of luminescent paint. He pressed his palm against the brick with exaggerated solemnity.

“First, we give the neighbourhood a reminder that the sign says yesterday’s date and that the city cannot keep us all too tidy,” Fred said.

“Is this your idea?” Harry asked.

“It was mine, and then it was stolen by George,” Fred said.

“Wasn’t stolen,” George said. “Borrowed and improved.”

“Do not ask me to watch you two,” Marisol said. “We have to keep this clean. If we’re seen, we are not pranks anymore.”

They kept their voices low, each word a little damp around the edges from the fog.

George wrote in neat strokes along the curb, turning the stale sign into something only half silly.

The words appeared first in faint glow and then brighter as he snapped the cap, all in a curling hand: **TASTING BY THE MOON: DO NOT PANIC.**

Fred added a tiny drawing of a grinning fish below it, and one of the boys by the bicycle noticed and laughed.

“Is this some film?” one of them asked.

“Not a film,” George answered. “A public service announcement.”

The boys looked pleased to have witnessed official nonsense and then went on with their cursing of the wind and their slow-sloshed argument about tires.

Marisol pulled Harry to the side. “Pranks done. We can keep moving.”

Harry nodded. The fog seemed to tighten between lampposts.

They reached the first of the old warehouses, a long low structure with a metal gate and no sign, as if no one wanted to claim responsibility. Marisol pointed with the back of her glove.

“See the lane just above us?” she murmured. “If you look toward the water, that little gap in the roofline gives a clear angle into the loading edge. We can watch from there and not be seen from the harbor cameras.”

There were no cameras there. Harry wanted to point this out but held it.

They moved quietly along the wall until a narrow rusted gate gave access to a half-collapsed service path. Fred used a keyring and no key looked useful, then decided to step over the lock and use momentum.

The path narrowed into a stone throat descending under awnings and stacked netting. Water dripped in steady tiny falls. The air had gone much colder.

Harry felt the pulse first when they reached the lower landing.

Not a cold. Not fear.

A pressure behind the ribs that seemed to count in little beats and then pause, as if a hand were kneading the night into a tighter knot.

He caught his breath and looked to Fred.

He saw Marisol seeing it too.

“Same timing as yesterday,” Harry said.

“Maybe,” Marisol said, and lowered her voice even further. “But today it is not under stone only. Listen.”

They all waited.

The sound was tiny at first: ropes shifting, and then a groan of timber from far below. Not a ship. Not any boat Harry recognized. There was no wind for a sail to complain against.

Fred leaned close to the edge and peered into dark water beyond the wharf. He whispered, “You can’t hear it as a single sound. It is like two things trying to agree.”

“Is this legal?” George asked.

“I can’t tell,” Marisol said, eyes fixed on the black water where thin lines of phosphorescent residue pulsed and vanished. “But it doesn’t matter if it is legal if we’re standing in the way.”

A low, wide vessel slid from beneath a warehouse shadow. No deck lights, no running lights, only one narrow band of greenish illumination running along its edge. It moved as if the fog were a doorway it was crossing through.

“What is that?” Harry whispered.

“It’s not the city service barge,” Fred said. “That paint line is custom and fresh.”

The vessel had three crates on deck under tarpaulin. Two men were visible on board, one standing by the bow, one by the stern. Their outlines were wrong too, their movements deliberate and without conversation. The man at the stern lifted one of the crates and gestured to the bowman with his gloved hand.

“No words,” Marisol said. “They’re trying not to be heard.”

George frowned. “I hate when grown-ups are that careful. They ruin all our fun.”

“Could still be smugglers?” Fred murmured.

Marisol held up a hand. “Smugglers here make noise and bribes and sometimes arguments. What’s on that boat is heavier than market theft.”

Fred drew back. “Could be food reserves for some weird church ritual.”

“Not with those covers,” George said.

Ron’s first static-buzzed ping came through the radio with a clipped click and buzz that Harry recognized as *stand by*. It gave only a fraction of a second of calm, but it was there.

“Do you want this for evidence?” Marisol asked.

Harry swallowed. “Maybe a photo.”

George nodded and produced a small clip camera from inside his satchel, one of those old school spy ones with a hand crank and a flash. He raised it and focused carefully through an oil-slick gap between crates.

Before he fired, a shape broke the fog near the bow.

A gull, only too white under the lamp-line, rose and then landed with a thump on a piling. The shape moved like an ordinary gull for two heartbeats, then unfolded into something bulkier, longer-necked, with a hooked beak and mottled plumage that looked wrong for local birds.

Harry had seen pelicans before only at a distance, but this one sat low and still and watched them with one bright eye that reflected green where the lamp should have made silver.

“Bigger than normal,” George said.

“Could be an injured bird,” Marisol said automatically.

“It is not breathing,” Harry said.

The bird did not move. One of its wings shifted a half inch, then stayed. It stood on the piling, head at exactly the same level as their eyes.

The pressure returned, stronger. One of the tiny pulses in Harry’s spine became a tug toward the water, and every beat now seemed to drag the edge of his hearing with it.

Fred looked at the boat again. “I’m not sure I trust either thing right now.”

Marisol stepped forward, crouched by the wall, and held out two fingers. “No direct approach,” she said. “From here we can get a second look when they unload. That boat won’t wait for us.”

They waited. The vessel came closer to a narrow dock below a shuttered door. No dockworkers shouted. No chains clinked. Instead one man opened a hatch and two of the three crates were slid down by pulley onto the edge of the dock. They were handled with gloved hands, each wrapped in a cloth with symbols stitched in dark thread.

“Symbols?” Harry said.

“Yes,” Marisol whispered.

“Not legal shipping marks,” Fred said. “These are hand done.”

The third crate was heavier, moved with two extra hands from a second boat not visible before. Harry could not see the boat, only the shoulders and boots emerging and disappearing at the edge of fog. They wore old work boots with no brand marks.

“Get one frame,” George said.

He crouched and clicked once, twice. The shutter made no sound. The men did not look up.

The crate had shifted and the tarpaulin edge bunched near the rear where a symbol had escaped in ink—a circle with teeth-like inward marks. Harry recognized the shape, vaguely, from Bill’s notes and the old cellhouse floor from the day before.

“Undertow,” he said under his breath.

Marisol’s hand found his elbow. “Too early to be sure. But do not say that word out loud unless you want all of us to start running.”

He kept still, angry at himself for feeling both thrilled and cold.

Across the dock, one of the men closed the hatch and turned as if someone had shouted from inside a wall. The green strip on the boat disappeared. For a heartbeat, Harry thought there had been no one aboard at all.

From the same direction as the boat’s earlier glow came a low metallic click. Not a mechanical click, a warning click from somewhere close, almost behind their left shoulder.

“Did you hear that?” George asked.

“Hear what?” Fred whispered.

The pelican moved.

No, not moved: shifted one precise step and then spread one wing as if to turn from one set of eyes to another. The green sheen in its eye flashed once brighter, then settled. Harry’s pulse jumped.

“I think that thing is not for fish,” he said.

Marisol said nothing. Her breathing was steady.

At the dock’s edge now, the crates were stacked by the emergency rail. The men pulled one of the side doors open and passed a narrow crate through an invisible handover to the shadow where a waiting cart stood. The cart wheels were covered. No rattle, no creak. Someone had padded them deliberately.

“Why are the wheels padded?” Harry asked.

“Because someone is afraid of noise,” Fred said. “Or trying to avoid being remembered.”

The third man arrived from the alley and made the sign no one among them understood: two fingers to temple, then chest.

“Counter-surveillance,” Marisol murmured. “That’s not smuggler language.”

“Or that’s language that says everyone is a smuggler at some point in their career,” Fred said.

The boats were no longer moving now. They arranged the crates in a line, each with blue marks that glowed only where the light struck them. One of the men opened a side hatch and handed a narrow crate to a waiting cart runner. The cart wheels had wrapped pads, and each movement was careful to the point of rehearsed silence.

“Why the pads?” Harry asked.

“Someone is either terrified of being heard,” Fred said, “or very comfortable with being seen.”

“Could be both,” Marisol said. “Either way, we are not staying.”

The third man from the alley joined them. He made a hand sign Marisol understood but did not.

“Counter-surveillance,” she said. “That’s not smuggler language.”

The pelican shifted on its piling above the dock and locked its green-glinting eye in their direction.

Harry felt the pressure in his spine answer it.

“Do we take the last frame?” he asked.

George checked the camera and nodded. “One more. Then vanish.”

The vessel door thudded shut. The man by the cart stepped up to them and asked in a low voice, “Who’s out there?”

No one replied.

Then Marisol hissed, “No direct approach. Keep in the lane. Don’t give them body lines.”

The three of them dropped behind crates. The bird sat above, patient enough to be mistaken for a piece of dockwork. Its beak never moved.

“Signal line,” George whispered as he saw it.

One of the men had already knotted a matte black copper braid to the railing and vanished the upper end into fog. It caught the lamp for a second and disappeared.

“Could be to map the lane,” Harry said.

“Could be to track who thinks he’s clever enough to pass by and leave,” Marisol said.

No one looked up when a gull screamed from the dark. A second cry came, then silence.

Marisol lifted two fingers and tapped the wall. Fred answered immediately with the same rhythm on steel and then, with theatrical confidence gone out of his face, pointed the route forward.

“Time for comedy,” she said, quieter than any joke. “We make noise where they are looking and go where they do not.”

She tossed a tiny metal frog into the lane near the far corner. The toy dropped, then tapped against stone in time with the water. A small green light blinked in its belly.

Every head on the dock turned.

“Who dropped that?” one of the men said.

Marisol didn’t wait for an answer. She drew Harry and Fred forward into the alley below their shadow and then cut right across a low wall where old hoses hung and old paint bled into the mud.

“Did we get enough?” Harry asked.

“Enough if we keep moving,” Marisol said.

The first lane opened into a broader one lined with stacked barrels. George joined from the opposite side, breathing like a rabbit and grinning without humor.

“There’s a paper tag here,” Fred said, pointing at a rusted drum. **KEEP THE WATER QUIET.**

“No,” Marisol snapped. “Don’t take it.”

She moved on with a single look of finality. “I can tell from the paper where it belongs. It is not ours.”

Ahead was a maintenance door set into a wall that had the old smell of river salt and electric dust.

“Signal shaft,” Marisol said. “Up one flight. Catwalk to rooftops. We split at the bend if we are lucky.”

The door opened with a dry sound. Inside, a staircase climbed into dark concrete and old gauges.

At the top they stepped into the edge of the industrial quarter. The fog looked heavier there, as if it had been kneaded into cloth.

Then the pelican rose, not to flee but to track. It hopped to a mast and rotated one slow circle, its eye flashing green with each turn.

“The watcher is still with us,” Fred said.

“Not with us,” Marisol said. “Ahead of us.”

Harry saw, for one breath, the tiny tube at its beak. It might as well have been an eye. He had the feeling of being written down.

“Retreat route two,” Marisol said. “No straight lines.”

George pointed. “Roof to church wall.”

Marisol nodded once. “Good. If anyone asks, we were on three sides.”

They crossed quickly, metal groaning under their weight, then broke to the left when a figure appeared in the corner of the lane below.

At the top of an old half-broken stair they heard Ron’s signal through the radio: two clicks, one buzz.

“Immediate retreat.”

“Noted,” Marisol said. “You drop and split exactly as rehearsed.”

She gave their final instructions: “Fred, go south to the old wall. Harry, stay with George and cut west. Keep noise down. Don’t turn and don’t explain to anyone if you get stopped.”

“I can’t promise I won’t be dramatic,” George said.

“Good,” Marisol said. “Dramatic is better than loud. Loud can be answered.”

Harry and George dropped down a narrow passage and entered a descending freight tunnel. The stale air carried a sour brine smell and old ink.

At one turn, two wet crates blocked the way, one split open by someone in haste. Within it lay several smooth, white polymer blocks wrapped in tape. Harry reached, then pulled one hand back.

“Not fish feed,” George muttered, lifting one, then showing him the pinhole markings around its edge.

They looked enough like the crate lines to keep the wrongness alive.

A scrape sounded deeper in the tunnel, then stopped. A woman’s whisper came in accented Spanish from ahead.

No se muevan.

George tightened his grip and started to turn. Marisol’s radio hissed in Harry’s pocket at once.

“If you hear my tone, go to Plan Sparrow. West to church wall. Keep moving.”

The scrape moved on. No voices followed.

They ran with borrowed calm and came out behind a sign where the old church wall rose from fog.

A final light winked and died at the far corner.

At the church wall corner they found Fred and Marisol waiting, breathing hard and smiling with that tired look people have when they have escaped without becoming stupid.

“You got the thing?” Fred asked.

“It’s enough,” Marisol said. “Not perfect.”

Harry checked his shoulder strap and saw his hands shake.

A black shape crossed the warehouse roof above them, and the pelican circled once before perching on the church finial.

Its head turned toward them, fixed and patient.

“We have proof,” Marisol said. “And we have a watcher.”

That was the moment they all understood they had done both: the prank and the reconnaissance.


“That’s what we needed,” Marisol said. “Not to like it. To know it is there.”

They were not quite at the safety of the alley network, but safe enough that talking did not cost them themselves.

Ron’s signal came through on a delayed click from their pocket radios, then static. “Status?”

Fred answered first, because he was always the one to speak when scared. “Status: alive, wet, annoyed, and carrying one partial evidence package.”

“Define package,” Ron said.

“Video frames, symbol seal on one crate with blue tape, movement of unmarked vessel, signal line to the fog,” Marisol said.

“Any casualties?”

“Only our sense of being amateurs,” George said.

Ron’s breath came through before his words. “Good. That can be fixed later. You are to head home separately. One at a time. No heroics. Keep to lit windows only at last crossing. Then report everything to Arthur when all in.”

Ron paused as if there were a thought he did not want to say out loud. Then: “And Harry—good call holding it.”

Harry looked at him through static and gave a tight nod though he could not see him.

Marisol slid a gloved hand down her hip and pulled out a tiny strip of red cloth, folded around something hard. She handed it to Harry.

“I found it while we waited on the catwalk,” she said. “One of those tags from the crate seam. I thought it was too small at first, but it has a date in it.”

Harry unfolded it carefully. The cloth held a tiny brass tag, water-stained and etched with the same teeth pattern, plus numbers. 11/9 and a symbol that repeated around the edge.

“Date,” he said.

“Not date,” Marisol said. “Rotation marker.”

“Meaning?”

“Not normal shipping. It was timed.”

Fred let out a low whistle. “Great. So this is organized and scheduled and no one told us, exactly as we feared.”

“It’s timed,” Harry repeated, unable to hide the pulse in his voice. “Like a spell cycle.”

“Like a tide cycle,” Marisol corrected. “That matters more than smugglers.”

They turned and moved through the lanes toward home, not together now but in two quick groups and then into one after one corner where the fog lifted enough for the old church cross to show.

On the way they passed an alley where someone had once sprayed a cartoon octopus in blue paint; the paint now looked like old bruises. George walked ahead and looked back at each shadow with the grin of someone pretending to be fearless while counting exits.

“Tomorrow’s plan?” Harry asked.

“Tonight we get in. Then we sleep,” Fred said.

“Then we don’t sleep,” George said. “Because you’re not done with the water.”

“Tomorrow,” Marisol added, “we trace where that vessel came from and where it went. Ron will coordinate. Arthur needs the map. Bill needs a sequence. If the tags are active, we tell everyone this is no weather and no market theft.”

Harry glanced at the brass tag again. The wet cloth smudged and then darkened in his palm. He could feel the pressure in his spine again, but now it had an edge of purpose.

They separated at the church lane where Marisol was heading toward her place and Fred and George toward the side stair where they had started.

“Come with me till the streetlight,” Marisol said to Harry.

He followed. The fog pressed against them like cloth in a drawer.

“I didn’t think we’d do this well,” he said after they had gone silent for a few blocks.

“You did think it,” she said. “You were the one who said this wasn’t just mischief.”

“I said it because it was true.”

“Not always the same thing,” she said. “Some nights are mischief, some nights are warning, some nights have both. If you can still joke while you’re scared, you learn where the danger is. If you can’t joke, you learn where to hide. We had both.”

He smiled despite himself. “You’re going to be the person who gives the best briefing.”

“I’ll leave that to Ginny and your father,” she said. “Tonight we make sure there is nobody else getting ambushed while sleeping.”

They reached a side porch where the house lights showed behind curtains. Marisol stopped before knocking. “One more thing.” She handed him a second photograph from her phone and then withdrew it.

“A better frame?” Harry asked.

She nodded. On the screen was one blurred image of the vessel from farther back, and in the background, near the cart rope line, something else: a metal ring set in the wall, three inches across, with the same teeth symbol engraved and already painted in blue glow.

“I almost missed it,” she said. “The ring was old, then lit from below when the cart moved. It’s not there to hold cargo. It’s there to move a current.”

“What current?”

She looked past him toward the dark street. “One that doesn’t belong to any tide we can name.”

A horn sounded once and then once more farther away. Marisol checked her watch. “Enough. Go in.”

Harry hesitated. “You coming?”

“Not tonight. I have to loop once more around the edge, make sure no line stays lit where it shouldn’t.”

“What if they see you?”

“They already do,” she said and smiled with no warmth. “That’s why we keep one step ahead.”

Then she vanished into fog so thick the space she occupied looked like a mistake.

Harry stood outside for a full breath after she disappeared, then went around the side and inside through the narrow service hall, where the lights were low and Ron sat at the old map table with three glasses of water already placed and two pens uncapped.

Ron stood at once. “You’re all back,” he said, relief not hidden.

Harry nodded and held up the camera and tag. He felt suddenly as if he had become a bridge between a joke and a war room.

“Sit,” Ron said, too calm. “Tell me everything. Start with the vessel and end with your pulse.”

Harry sat and found words with less hesitation than he expected.

He spoke in short pieces, because the details came easiest that way.

- They went by back lane under pretext of changing a sign.
- They watched unlit craft unload marked crates at unguarded dock.
- Symbols matched the pattern near Ward line points.
- A giant pelican behaved like a sensor.
- Signal line, padded wheels, private transfer.
- Hidden ring and tag with tide marker.
- One clip captured enough for two clear frames.
- They escaped by alternate route via old printing press and tunnel.

Ron wrote none of it down for maybe forty seconds and then looked up with eyes that had gone darker.

“Did anyone see you?” he asked.

Harry gave him the blunt truth. “Yes. Maybe directly. Maybe through something else. But they looked only where the toy moved.”

Ron nodded. “Good. Confusion is our ally.”

“Could be a good night,” Fred said from the stairs where he and George appeared one by one like wet ghosts.

“Tonight was useful,” Ron said.

“And frightening,” George added.

“And funny,” Fred said.

“Fine,” Ron said. “Now we count what made it useful.”

He laid the brass tag next to the map and held a pen over it, drawing three circles connected by arrows. “This is no local smuggling racket. This is structured movement tied to a symbol and timed points. Harry, the pattern in your chest and Marisol’s patrol route are matching. That means they are using a city path as an extension, not a cover.”

Harry had never had Ron say that word, *city path,* before.

“What’s a city path?” he asked.

Ron pushed the tag toward him. “A corridor no one maps, because everyone assumes one thing is fixed and no longer dangerous.”

Marisol stepped into the doorway behind him, hair damp, coat buttoned wrong from moving fast. “Not fixed,” she said. “Only ignored.”

She placed the better photograph on the table. “The ring in the wall looked old enough for an old warning. It was activated by cart movement. Someone has tied this old thing to a new sequence.”

Bill, who had come up from downstairs in a fresh coat and the face of someone who preferred facts before theories, glanced once and then straightened.

“This is the first proof of active transfer since we started suspecting it,” he said quietly.

Arthur appeared at the back with Molly close behind. Arthur raised his eyebrow at Harry and then nodded as if to say, *You did not break us.*

Molly said nothing, and instead set tea on the table anyway.

No one touched it. The room had no sound for a long moment except rain tapping the gutters and the low vibration of the town’s distant rail line.

Then Arthur set one cup down. “No one goes out again tonight alone,” he said to the room as much as to anyone.

He looked at Fred and George. “You have not been denied your fun. You have learned where this town hides its fear.”

“That is one way of saying we get to keep doing it,” Fred said.

Arthur almost smiled. “If you keep bringing me evidence with it.”

Harry watched the three adults at the table and realized this was the first time in many years that he felt not like an intruder in their family work but like someone expected to fill a gap.

Molly touched his sleeve. “You are still trembling,” she said.

“Just from the fog,” he said.

She gave him a look half-infirmary, half-gratitude. “Drink your tea before your thoughts catch up.”

He took the cup. His hands were still cold where the tag had touched them.

In the window behind Bill, the fog shifted and thinned for a moment, enough for one sliver of distant water to show through as black glass. In that line he saw again the pelican on the church finial, and this time it seemed to be perched beside the shadow of a man, as if both were waiting for the same signal.

Harry set the cup down and said, quietly, almost to no one, “Tomorrow we should map all waterfront movement within this radius.”

Ron answered before anyone else could. “Tomorrow?”

Harry nodded once. “Tonight we’ve got one proof. Tomorrow we need the route and the watchers. If we wait, they move the clock.”

Fred whooped softly. “He’s got the right kind of panic now.”

“Not panic,” said Marisol. “Commitment.”

Arthur set the map open flat. “Good. Then start clean. We will use channels only we understand.”

Harry felt the edges of the room narrow and widen in turns, as if he were being pulled into a rhythm he had not controlled but could follow. Outside, the fog came in thicker again, and somewhere beyond it a bird gave the kind of cry that did not belong to local gulls.

He looked up, and Marisol was already looking at the same window. Their eyes met.

She gave the smallest nod. The nod was not triumph, not fear. It was recognition.

He knew now, with a certainty he had never been allowed in class or corridor, that they had crossed into something that would not stay local forever. It had watchers with names. It had timing. It had a map and a mechanism. It had a pelican that watched without blinking.

It had a beginning, and it had made a first move.
