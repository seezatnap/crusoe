# Chapter 07
<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno took the same lane as always and stood as if she had been carved to stand there.

The intake wall did not greet her. It offered only the standard menu of private channels, queue light, and a row of neutral symbols that had never once had a face but had learned to ask too much with their silence.

She had told herself for months that this was the same every day.

She had told herself that a person could be present in a room and still be absent from it.

She had told herself many things for many reasons.

The first request came in before the station settled. The second came faster than the first should have. The third arrived with a warning icon that did not belong to any known protocol.

`EN-33-156 / access packet`

`owner: ORI-TH`

`status: approved`

`note: do not ask questions`

It was the kind of line that should have made her laugh.

She did not.

On her screen, the metadata for packet EN-33-156 was already incomplete:

`recording: mixed-lab cluster, unindexed`

`run depth: extended`

`resonance risk: moderate`

`bleed threshold: elevated`

There was no human note.

At first she thought it was a system fault and tapped the icon once, as if one tap could restore a human voice.

`open with review lock`

No review lock.

`open with review lock: disabled`

No review lock.

She felt her eyes move before her mind agreed. She should refuse open. She should queue this for Orin, for policy, for a colleague with a warmer idea of limits. She should ask Fen to take the slot.

Instead, she opened it.

No one was watching her. No one ever watched her without believing she was being watched.

The jump happened while she still had one boot in work and one boot in thought, and the return came with a taste like pennies and rain.

Rain, she thought.

In the Lattice, rain did not happen.

The instruction board had already gone dark once when she blinked.

She found herself with a new line in her own queue and an older one in her shoulder, though there were no shoulders and no queue and no rain.

She did not pause.

That was the first visible symptom.

She stood still, looked like a person waiting for permission and then executed four clean jumps without checking the room had consented.

The room did not grant permission for anything. It simply became the place where she put it.

By the time she returned to the wall she had used the old voice in her head to call the sensation """copper weather,""" then decided the phrase was wrong and changed it in the private notes.

`Copper is not weather.`

`Copper is residual transfer residue.`  

`Do not name it in this room.`

`Do not make your line a weather report.`

She deleted the line before she could send it to anyone.

The station did what stations do when one person has taken one step away from them. It kept moving as if everything were unchanged.

A junior Finder stood by the shared table, looked in her direction, and lowered a stack of run forms.

Hi, Juno. Good morning.

She gave the person one nod. No smile. No return gesture.

`good morning` did not reach her voice.

At the far edge of the wall, an older curator had turned from the same cluster and held a hand up to signal a delayed report.

Not for her. Not yet.

She read the signal as a warning, and then she pretended she had not.

The first thing she did after lunch was miss a handoff.

No, not at lunch. At the line before lunch, when the corridor brightened into a color nobody used for practical work.

She had a standard handoff scheduled with Fen, not about the latest task but about a line that she thought she could not complete alone.

`fen / memory bridge / EN-33-123`

`cross-check with lane log`

`status: pending`

She had promised herself: no more pending.

She had made all those promises in versions of herself that still believed discipline would hold.

She opened the draft handoff.

`Fen: I""'m seeing overlap in witness markers when we move from Lena to Sable. It looks like pattern bleed, but the phrase keeps returning even in unrelated chains.`  

`Fen: If this is fixation only, we can still report as risk.`

`Fen: If not, we may need to stop this.`

`Fen: let me know before noon.`

`From: Juno`  

`do not use this line in public.`  

`send after private verification.`

The draft sat there with three blank lines under it and no second paragraph for her.

She needed one minute to be honest. She gave herself twelve.

In that minute she looked up from the windowless wall and saw her own reflection in the polished edge of a station terminal. Her face was still hers by outline and still familiar by shape, but the outline was thinner and the shape had the tired, careful edges of someone who had been folded and set upright too long.

When she blinked it changed.

She did not trust that.

She closed the draft and sent it as-is.

`message queued`

Fen never responded fast enough to save a person.

She had never needed him to.

That belief had lasted a dozen weeks.

***

By the time the queue moved through mid-cycle, the room had become too clean.

Every desk had the same white edges. Every monitor had its own obedient glow. Every pair of people who had talked to her in the last hour had left with one sentence hanging in the air.

She could not remember the sentence from the first one.

The second had asked whether she was in.

She had answered, """I am."""

That was true in six different ways and false in ten more.

She moved to the end bay and turned off her peripheral broadcast.

No one does that unless they are trying to disappear from all channels for six minutes at a time.

She stood still through three calls.

The first call displayed an icon from Archives: `Need updated chain note before shift end.`

The second was from Fen: `You dropped your lane sync.`  

The third was from Orin""'s assistant: `Curator office asks whether you can be available at second bell.`  

She ignored all three.

Not because she was rude, and not because she had decided to be.

She ignored them because each message demanded a version of herself she had stopped having.

Around her, someone asked for help with indexing and did not need it. Someone else closed a channel because her silence was now an event. Someone said her name out loud near the tea station and then changed the subject to the weather in old records.

She heard the word weather and felt the corridor tilt.

`Weather in old records` used to be harmless. In this chapter it was a nail.

She returned to the intake desk with deliberate slowness and pressed the small key that disabled nonessential alerts.

`suppress low-priority`

`suppress low-priority: active`

At that exact moment she could have gone to any number of places.

She did not go to Fen.

She did not go to Orin.

She did not go to the tea station where she used to keep her coat.

She did the one thing no one would have predicted from this architecture.

She opened an unsanctioned link.

No alarm sounded first. There was no alarm for that path. The first sign was a line of gray in the bottom of her vision, a reminder of how old records felt before anyone taught her to ignore their own edges.

The jump held.

Not a jump, not cleanly. A fragment.

The fragment sat behind everything, a memory that was not hers and yet pressed against her own with the old insistence of a hand at the door.

### Recording fragment

The lab was narrow and smelled of wet concrete after heating pipes had burned out in January.

Lena was alone at first, sleeves rolled, hand on the side of a console with three dead stickers on it. She had just heard the volunteer say something she had not heard the same way before. She looked at the waveform and felt the room get too quiet to be real.

Marcus""'s voice was in the room but distant, like someone speaking through the seam between two walls.

`Witness index stable?`

Lena had answered with a note in her own hand, not the digital line.

`No.`  

`Not this morning.`  

`We are standing at the hinge.`  

`Do not call this safety.`  

She wrote those words and knew she would never use that phrase again.

The volunteer was not in the room anymore, not by body, but by some other arrangement of voice and pulse.

Sable stood in the doorway with a folder of handwritten pages.

You can call it witness and think it is neutral, she said, but witness changes the witness too.

Lena turned from the board to the older woman with a look that held no argument and no surrender. Her hands had no room in them for either.

`A room can""'t hold everything, Sable.`

`It only holds what we keep asking for.`  

The fragment ended there, at a line about rooms and keeping, and no one in the Lattice had yet learned that all rooms had appetite.

*** 

When Juno returned the corridor was at a different angle.

She stood with her hands clasped in front of her as if she were cold.

She could still hear the fragment in the corner of her hearing and hated it.

She could still feel her own pulse in that recorded corridor and hated that too.

She did not know how long she had been gone.

`queue backlog: 42`

`orphaned handoff: fen`

`review packet open: EN-33-156`

`safety note: repeated low-threshold overlap`

The room had already moved on.

Someone touched her shoulder.

"""Juno, you all right?""" It was Fen, close enough to avoid any delay, far enough to leave him at the edge of her personal radius.

She turned and made the mistake of trying to answer with a simple phrase.

I""'m fine.

The sentence sounded like she had said it in a different register entirely.

Fen gave her that look people use when they have watched a person walk into the back of their own house with a key and come back with wet hands.

He did not touch the shoulder again.

"""Can I ask if you""'re missing because you""'re tired, or because you""'re somewhere else and trying not to tell me where?"""

She did not answer immediately.

She had a lot of habits older than this relationship. One of them was not giving people the exact line they wanted.

She picked the safe one.

"""I""'m in a line."""

Fen did not move.

"""You""'ve been in that line for six hours. You didn""'t answer the handoff. You ignored the queue alert. You turned your broadcasts down without leaving a status."""

She kept her face at the corridor shape.

"""I was doing what had to be done."""

"""That is not always the phrase that keeps people from losing track of you."""

His words were not loud. They were too careful.

She wanted to say she was not disappearing. She was concentrating.

She wanted to say everyone else was comfortable with their own continuity and she only owed herself to this work.

She wanted to say she did not know what to do with the thing the room had shown her.

She said none of those things.

"""I know."""

Fen frowned.

No one had used that inflection with her in years.

"""How do you know?"""

She opened her mouth then closed it before speech made a liar out of the room.

"""I know this is why you came."""

Fen took a step back as though she might fall forward.

"""I came because you looked like you were running the wrong way through the same door for three cycles."""

She felt the old warmth of embarrassment, and with it the much younger version of herself that had believed she could manage alone.

"""Don""'t start with doors,""" she said.

`don""'t start with fear` she wrote in her private scratch line.

Fen did not miss it. He knew the rhythm now.

"""I""'m not starting with fear,""" he said. """I""'m starting with you. You haven""'t slept, you""'re writing in a shorthand no one can sign, and your bleed markers are all lit. That""'s three signs of someone not doing the work and calling it excellence."""

"""I am doing this work,""" she said.

He gave a small, bitter laugh.

"""You""'re doing this work as if it is a confession booth and everyone else is optional."""

She opened her private channel and wrote:

`Need external witness.`  

`Need immediate interruption protocol.`  

`I can""'t ask you to be my safety now if I can""'t ask you to be present.`  

He saw her stop before she sent.

"""You can if you can send it."""

She sent it, then added one line:

`Not asking.`

The line looked weak once she sent it. It was meant to be strong.

He laughed once, softly.

"""You never did understand direct requests."""

She did not laugh.

She turned back to the queue and reopened a handoff panel.

`Fen note: need interruption.`  

She hovered the pointer over the confirm line.

`status: draft`

`last edited: now`

`action: share full timeline with fen`

She did not send.

The old reflex won.

Need to remain legible.

Need to remain useful.

Need to avoid the chain from taking its shape in the open.

She pressed confirm.

`status: queued`

She returned to lane three and let five cycles pass in which she made no edits to anyone""'s life except her own.

***

Around second bell, the workroom changed tone.

People who had ignored her now glanced at her from the side of their attention, the way people assess a bridge that might carry them if it gives out.

The message from the Curator office was still waiting.

`Curator office asks you are available for urgent policy check.`  

`location: Office C-2`

`topic: extension and restricted chain`

She could have gone.

She did not.

She did not because she had started receiving what passed for a real headache in a non-biological architecture.

Not pain.

An insistence.

Each time she looked at a clean interface she saw the old line again, the line from Sable in the fragment.

A room cannot hold everything.

Could she hold that much?

The corridor gave her no answer.

That afternoon, when the tea station cycle started, no one turned up with the usual cups. She did not even have tea in that machine anymore, no one had that kind of patience for her. She sat alone at the edge and watched the floor of the room shift under a new run packet.

`EN-33-158 / correction chain / historical`

`target: Lena`

`depth: exploratory`

`risk: symbolic overlap with unindexed`

She recognized the pattern. Too close. Too quick.

She moved the packet to a pending tray and left it unopened, something she would have considered unthinkable the week before.

Then Fen appeared at her shoulder again, not in corridor but at the table behind her. He did not ask permission.

"""I""'m going to stand with you in this or against it,""" he said.

She looked at him with all the old annoyance of someone who wanted rescue but feared dependency.

"""You""'re not a witness. You""'re noise."""

He didn""'t smile.

"""Maybe. But I am one noise you know. I""'m here until you decide I can""'t be."""

She stood and found all her movements had become too efficient.

"""You can go back."""

He shook his head.

"""No. Not until you tell me where the room is taking you."""

`too much of a good thing` she thought and hated how exactly she could predict the way his voice held.

"""You""'re overplaying this,""" she said.

"""Then show me the real work,""" Fen said. """Tell me the part you""'re not telling Orin."""

The old architecture of trust had no place for this sentence. It opened an unindexed door.

She watched two monitors where the corridor had folded into white rectangles.

One of them held her running log for EN-33-156.

She could not hide it.

`continuity: sustained`  

`witness overlap: persistent`  

`bleed: intermittent`  

`decision point: continue or isolate`

Fen read nothing. He did not need to.

"""You found a person in all those background marks,""" he said. """You think this is obsession. Maybe it is. But we don""'t call it obsession when it helps us. We call it pattern."""

She hated the way he was right.

"""Pattern is only useful if we get out in time,""" she said.

He nodded once.

"""Then we do this your way: short run, full note, full stop if you drift."""

"""You can""'t instruct me."""

"""I can stand in the doorway and count."""

The way he said it sounded like childhood.

She did not answer. She did not have an answer.

She returned to lane one and opened EN-33-156 to a controlled frame. The record began as background audio, not a scene. She saw three people moving in a narrow corridor in old rain, and one of those people was turning a wrench no one had asked her to identify.

For six seconds it felt like she was still in 2030.

Then the old phrase returned:

`If this is the room we built, then what in it counts as honest?`

The line did not belong to the recording.

It had come with Lena, with Sable, with herself, with all of them.

Her chest tightened against the architecture and she did what she had promised herself never to do:

She cut the run before the end.

The room did not appreciate interruption when no alarm was due.

The warning appeared anyway.

`run terminated by finder`

`partial witness captured`  

`symbolic overlap unresolved`

`bleed: active`

"""I did that on purpose,""" she said, not to him, but to the room.

Fen did not answer.

He slid a hand to the nearest console and muted one of her peripheral channels anyway, as if he had a right.

"""That""'s me exercising the right of a friend,""" he said.

The sentence startled her.

Some friendships were too kind to deserve this.

`I remember when you used to tell me this is just method.`  

`I used to think method was enough.`  

`Method left a lot of unsaid things.`  

Her private notes got too full for neat lines.

She swallowed hard and almost reached for the old joke she used to make when overwhelmed.

Too dry for this room.

She looked at Fen.

He was waiting for a response and not saying what that meant.

She gave one answer that did not expose everything.

"""Fine."""

He held the line there for a breath.

"""Then I""'m stepping back from panic for one hour."""

"""Define stepping back."""

"""No private unsupervised jump. No private unsupervised analysis. No pretending you can carry this by yourself."""

There it was again, the same old line with old grammar.

She almost said no.

She said, """Fine."""

And that was not a refusal.

It was the closest thing to permission she could trust.

Fen finally looked relieved and in relief looked tired.

"""Good,""" he said, and left the first half of the sentence unsaid.

She watched him go.

He had always asked for the line she did not know she could borrow.

***

The station quieted after noon.

At the moment she thought she had the room under command, another alarm entered without fanfare.

Not on the corridor.

Not in her private log.

On her shoulder.

She touched no interface and still read it:

`ALARM: external check-in`

`requestor: Cassiel Vey`

`status: inbound / urgent`

Fen had seen the icon first.

"""You""'ve invited him in,""" he said from where he waited behind the tea counter.

Juno did not react.

"""He did not need to. I had to answer the request."""

She had not asked her own system to grant access. She had not asked anyone.

Maybe the room had done it. Maybe someone else had changed her privacy layer from old history.

She touched the contact to confirm.

`allow temporary proximity`

`duration: 1 cycle`

`recording allowed: no`

It was enough.

By the time the private channel opened, Cassiel stood in the doorway.

He did not enter quickly. He stood at the threshold with the same stillness he used in galleries, as if he expected a room to reveal itself only if he did not demand its name.

She had seen him first in the Archive of older cities and in her private walk-throughs, in rooms made by his hands where rivers and stars could coexist if someone asked them politely.

She had not seen him by his real body line in this room for almost thirty years.

"""You came looking for me,""" she said.

Her voice sounded too flat.

He gave a wry, small smile that landed two beats late.

"""I came to return something you said you did not want."""

`deflection`

`deflection`

She stared.

He held up a folded piece of paper with an old station seal. One of those seals had no legal force and all the force you needed in personal weather.

It was an unopened note she had sent him three weeks ago in a dead zone of private channels: a request for """quiet period,""" no details, no request for return.

She had not expected him to follow up. She had not expected him to have come for that, and not this.

"""You got there before you were supposed to,""" she said.

Cassiel gave the smallest nod.

"""The old channels still work. You should know that."""

Fen had stayed in the room but outside earshot, pretending not to have been invited and pretending he did not have to be.

Juno read the paper and felt a second pulse in her palm that did not belong to anything.

No one says """I love you""" to an absent person for no reason.

She had loved him in pieces and resentments. She had loved him in arguments and missed his silence in exactly the same tone as his presence.

She unfolded the note.

`You once said:`

`if you disappear from the present, find me in the oldest room you have left.`  

`I think you already did.`  

There were no signatures. No explanation. No accusation.

She held it and returned it.

Cassiel did not touch it.

"""You think I came because I""'m sentimental,""" he said. """I came because Fen made this sound like neglect, not caution."""

"""Fen called it neglect,""" she said.

"""He called it alarm."""

`alarm` was a useful word until she used it too often.

"""You think he""'s right,""" she said.

Cassiel moved the last of his travel shadow and turned toward the wall.

"""No,""" he said. """I think he is frightened. Frightened for you, for himself, for being too late. He""'s not wrong."""

She crossed her arms.

"""I""'m not broken."""

He met her eyes.

"""I know."""

"""I don""'t need another person in this room pretending I need rescuing."""

"""I""'m not pretending."""  

"""I didn""'t ask you to go through this with me."""

"""No,""" he said, and there was no softness then.

"""And that""'s exactly what this room did to us. You didn""'t ask me to go with it. It made the room where we could not stay for the same length of time."""

The word `us` came too soon, and then she had no way to take it back.

He nodded once, without flinching.

"""I know what I did,""" she said, too quickly. """I came home to the room and found everything else in the queue."""

He looked surprised for half a second.

"""The queue? The architecture?"""

She shook her head.

"""The room with no room. The way this place teaches you to choose absence as discipline."""

He tilted his head, and she saw something old there: not accusation, not pity, an old, practical sadness.

"""Do you remember the first mural we built in the old floodplain map?"""

She did not want to answer.

"""Because we made the sky there,""" he continued, """not because we believed in the sky, but because we needed somewhere else to stand when the room kept asking us to disappear."""

The sentence landed.

She did.

Fen appeared in the doorway then, and his timing broke all old habits.

He saw Cassiel and nodded without making introductions.

"""I didn""'t mean to interrupt,""" Fen said.

"""No,""" Cassiel answered. """You were right not to."""  

Juno almost laughed at the line.

Fen looked between them.

"""You""'re early,""" Juno said to Cassiel.

"""I was earlier than this morning,""" he said.

"""You can leave."""

"""Not if this is what I think it is."""

She looked at him sharply.

`what is this, interrogation?` she thought.

Fen stepped forward.

"""Juno""'s status has changed in the last two cycles,""" he said. """You should have seen it coming if you were monitoring."""

Cassiel""'s shoulders dropped fractionally.

"""Fen,""" he said.

"""I know. I""'m not trying to replace you."""

Juno cut in.

"""No one is replacing anyone here. Not in these rooms."""

Cassiel nodded.

"""I know you think I""'m late,""" he said, """but I didn""'t come to win."""

She exhaled.

No one ever expected that from him: `I didn""'t come to win.` It sounded too clean.

"""You came to prove you still know where I am."""

"""I came because I remember where you told me to find you when you disappear."""

She felt a flicker of anger that was almost relief.

"""You were not there last cycle when I needed one word of witness."""

She looked straight at him before she could stop it.

"""That was not the last cycle."""

"""Wasn""'t it?""" she said.

"""No,""" he replied. """It was this cycle."""

`this cycle` meant the same as no absolution.

Fen stood with the practical patience of someone trying to hold two clocks with one hand.

"""Can we keep this to what she needs now?""" he said.

Juno almost accepted. She almost accepted the kindness.

She moved the conversation before either man could fill the gap.

"""What do you want, Cassiel?"""

He did not pretend.

"""I want your attention for five minutes with no archive between us. I want you to tell me the shape of the danger as if this room did not exist."""  

"""I want to know if you are going to let your work turn into a weather pattern you call mission."""

She felt the old wound where his words had once cut clean and true.

`You once accused me of loving ghosts`

`He calls the Archive a ghost when I needed him to see a person.`  

She had no desire to finish that argument.

But if she did not answer this one, it would become his question forever.

"""I""'m trying to stay inside one person,""" she said. """Mine, this cycle. I can""'t do it without crossing all of yours."""

He listened like this was a line she had not yet written before anyone else could.

"""Is this about Orin?"""

"""Everything in these rooms ends at Orin eventually."""  

She almost smiled.

"""You sound like you do."""

She shook her head.

"""Not because I sound anything. Because I am the one in the room when the room starts asking for the past."""

Cassiel said nothing.

The silence did not heal. It made room.

Then Fen spoke, very gently, practical as always.

"""She is not saying she needs to stop. She is saying the structure is off and she is trying not to let it swallow the present."""

Cassiel looked at her in a way that was not asking permission.

`I am in every room where you leave a part of yourself`, he said.

He said it with his old low steadiness.

"""I don""'t want to fix this for you."""

"""Then don""'t."""

"""Then what do you want?"""

"""To know if you""'re safe enough for me to stay in this room a while."""

She could have said no.

She could have turned the request into a warning and sent him out.

She could have done anything that would have preserved her dignity.

She said nothing.

She looked at Fen, who was looking at both of them as if this conversation had never ended in any version of their history and could still be edited.

She looked back at Cassiel.

His expression had become almost boyish then, and that frightened her more than anything.

"""Stay, then,""" she said.

"""On what terms?"""

"""No art rescue."""

He almost smiled at that.

"""No art rescue?"""

"""No art speeches. No claims that this is all the Lattice teaching you how to feel. You stand. You witness. You do not make this into a canvas."""

He nodded slowly.

"""And you stop telling me you do not need witness while insisting nobody touches your line."""

She could not hold that tone; she hated that he used it.

"""I need it,""" she admitted, as quietly as she had said less honest things.

Fen exhaled.

"""That""'s enough."""

He walked to the private table and pulled up her monitor.

"""I""'m going to run a fast pass on your run log. If you cross this line again without a check-in, I""'m writing it into the packet."""

"""You don""'t get that authority."""

"""Not now."""  

He did not argue with her own history and all its old architecture. He just did it anyway.

"""You""'re not the one signing off on anything."""

She nodded once.

"""No. But I can be the one with a record."""

The phrase hit the room with a surprising kindness.

She did not argue.

She looked at the line between her and Cassiel, where old promises could have become walls if they had both been weaker.

At least this one did not close.

She opened her private notes and rewrote the section that mattered most.

`Need external witness: Fen (status active). Cassiel (temporary proximity, no policy interference).`

`No unsupervised jump > 4 min.`  

`No private return with no log.`  

`If overlap repeats: immediate pause + shared channel.`  

`Do not mistake warning for recovery.`  

She sent the note to both and paused.

`You want to see the archive fragment?"""` Cassiel asked.

She shook her head.

`If I show it to you, you""'ll read me as a person and not as a person I can lose.`  

She had no language for that and sent none.

Instead she said, """I can""'t."""

He nodded.

At least he accepted.

"""Then I""'ll stay anyway,""" he said.

In a room that rarely tolerated old promises, that was either the most reckless thing he had said or the most honest.

The corridor light shifted twice. Somewhere, a station announced a shift handover.

"""I""'m not sure you understand,""" she said, not unkindly.

`Understated`

`No, I understand enough.`

"""It is not one thing."""

"""I know.""" He did not move.

He watched her check the handoff and send it to Fen.

At around this point, the room gave her the second warning she no longer could ignore.

`bleed drift: high`

`interference markers: active`

`line continuity at risk`

`recommend: pause all non-urgent work`

She laughed once and immediately felt ashamed for laughing.

"""The room""'s recommending for me now,""" she said.

Fen met her look. """Rooms are allowed to be boring. You don""'t have to answer."""

Cassiel looked from her to the warning and then to Fen.

"""What does it mean, exactly?""" he asked.

"""It means I have too little distance between what I am and what I am carrying,""" Fen said.  

"""It means she is beginning to write from someone else""'s residue."""

The old wound reopened because he spoke `residue` as if this were a technical term, and to her it felt exactly personal.

She looked at her own hands and saw only the outline of decision.

No one said anything while the warning remained open.

She could still feel the memory of Sable in that old corridor.

Do not mistake shape for healing.

Do not mistake healing for freedom.

The line returned, and with it, the first clear fear she had not yet admitted.

She moved to the queue station and opened the handoff to Fen again.

She added one final line:

`I did not choose the room.`

`I choose the one path through it that keeps one other person real.`

`If that is not enough, say so.`  

She sent.

Fen read it as though he had expected exactly that and wished she did not have to choose words.

Cassiel read it as though he had expected to be refused and had already made himself smaller.

She sat again and let the corridor return to ordinary shape.

For the first time in hours there was no copper taste.

She let a short breath pass.

`status: paused`

`status: observed`

`status: no jump`

No one was in the room to applaud.

This was the part where work did not end cleanly.

That was why she kept breathing.

Outside, a maintenance panel cycled and the room gave no hint of what the next cycle might ask of any of them.

She did not know if one cycle at a time was enough.

She only knew she had two witnesses now and no permission to disappear.

The line on the wall was still there before she could avoid it:

`What do we owe each other when the room gives us an honest way to stay apart?`

She looked at Fen, and then at Cassiel, and felt the ache of choosing.

"""Then we stay,""" she said.

That was the most work she had done all day, and perhaps the least.
