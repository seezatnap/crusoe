# Chapter 15 - Homeward Seal

The city had gone white around the edges when Harry came to his feet.

Not dawn, exactly, because the fog in San Francisco was always already older than the day and would not say what belonged to which hour. It pressed around the old Underlook stairwell in a wet, patient way, as if it had survived the collapse and was waiting to see what people did now that they had no excuses left.

The tide had not yet reached them, but it had announced itself with a low iron sound from below.

Harry stood with his back to the far wall, hand on the sling of his wand arm, and stared at the lane they had just abandoned.

For a moment he felt as if he had run in place, as if the children were still in the first wave and he had never crossed to safe ground. His mouth tasted of salt. His shirt stuck to his skin. His fingers had gone so tight he could feel the shape of each knuckle in his palm. Across the lip of the stair he could see Arthur and Bill moving as if they were each carrying two thoughts and neither one could be dropped: one to keep people alive, one to keep a plan intact while alive.

Then the fog thinned just enough for Voss to stand out.

He was not behind them, as before, not among his own men, not in command of the room. He stood three bodies back from the last stable edge, hands open and wrong in the way a man looks when he has lost his audience but not his certainty. His cane was gone now, the one with the false-warded wand inside it. Tomo had taken it earlier when she bound it to a stone with a ward-lock. Even without it he looked expensive and careful, almost dignified. He looked like a man still giving a speech in a room that had emptied itself of believers.

Harry saw the pupils first. Tiny, bright, and fixed.

Then the words arrived.

"Stay. Stay where you are. Look at me."

The voice did not come from a wand. It came from somewhere behind the ear, from the back of a throat that had never really raised its own pitch because it had lived on other people’s. It was no shout and no hiss. It was a hand pressing exactly where a person kept the private hinge of choice.

Harry’s first response was the old body-memory of panic.

The voice had known panic; he had lived under worse. The old ward in his chest that had learned to flinch at certain frequencies pulled its curtain up and the room seemed to bend, as if every object were behind thick glass and he had to walk through it. His feet wanted to hold still. His jaw wanted to obey. The words came with the polite cruelty of logic: *just this once, you do only this little thing*.

At that moment he thought of all the places he had been told to be small.

The cupboard under the stairs. The end of the road where people pretended they had not noticed him at the school door. The time in the train carriage where voices in perfect British accents made him believe he had caused the wrongness by breathing too loud. He thought of the Weasleys’ kitchen, of Molly’s hands on a hot pan and then her hand on his shoulder and then Arthur’s face when he had asked Harry if he wanted a second slice of bread with butter as if he meant it. He thought of Ginny’s careful line in her sketchbook where the line never stopped once drawn properly.

It was all there in one rush, all private and all impossible, and the voice tried to turn it into an instruction.

"Do not answer them. Stay still and count my words."

He did not say no. He did not feel sure what no would sound like.

He found another way.

A memory came first, and then the thought that had no shape but had somewhere to stand.

*Home.*

The word came like a stone dropped into the pool where the fog had pooled behind his ribs.

He did not let the word break. He held it, then held stillness around it.

"No," he said.

Not loud. Not dramatic. Just enough to make the space around the words hear him. His own voice sounded like he had borrowed it from someone else for a while and only now got it back.

Voss’s expression changed in an instant. The compulsion did not vanish; it recoiled.

No one in the group could have identified what changed physically, but everyone could feel it: the tunnel stopped holding its breath.

Harry felt the pressure fall a hair. Not gone. Just no longer all the way in him.

Ron, on his right, moved first and set a hand on Harry’s shoulder so he could feel the edge of someone else’s steadiness. Marisol was already halfway to him, eyes wide and jaw set.

"You all right?" she asked.

"Yes," Harry said. He was amazed by how ordinary that word sounded after the moment had passed.

"Stay," said Arthur from the lip, "with me. No one moves alone."

Voss had stopped speaking to Harry, but the spell still had nowhere else to go. The wave rolled off him and onto the fog in the lane behind, and for two heartbeats it looked like the room might seize. Then the old walls replied.

Below, the Underlook breathed in.

No one had heard the actual sound of a tide turning inside stone, but they all felt it at once as a deep shudder and the smell of wet salt that had no business being there.

The old magical wing of Alcatraz, already wounded by the rituals and now stripped of the final anchors, had opened every forgotten sluice in one long decision.

Molly’s shell snapped shut once around the children and held.

"Run line!" Bill snapped. "Not fast. Not fast. Keep one arm where you can count it."

Arthur did not look back. He turned toward the dark, where Tomo and Gus and two BMA ward-guards were already appearing as if someone had called them from a colder corridor of reality.

Arthur’s mouth never changed shape. "Anchor release in ten. Wait for Bill’s mark."

Tomo nodded, already halfway into a spell she did not complete, because she was speaking at the same time to the nearest BMA officer. "Ward break at seam three. We need to keep one corridor open as exit only. If he gives it one more cycle, we lose three layers and children are in a vacuum corridor."

Bill’s mark was not a wave of light; it was a sharp tap, three times, to his wrist and then the stone.

"Now!" he called.

The children moved.

Behind them the first surge came up the old service channel, a dark rolling front that had once been a trickle and now had the mass and confidence of an offended sea. It came through the lane with no warning, no white foam, no dramatic hiss, just the certainty of water taking its place because something else had decided it could.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Marisol ran with heads down and eyes level on the path, and for once no one joked about it. The twins were behind, shoulder to shoulder as if they had always been in battle formation, and even Fred and George moved as if their satchels were not packed with fireworks but with lifeboats.

One woman cried out and Arthur turned his wand in one small arc to hold her up and then held her with that spell long enough to move her out of the path of the surge.

"You are safe if you trust your feet," he shouted, not to the children but to himself.

The old stone was slick under every boot. Water lapped to one shoulder and then above it. Molly kept her shell with a hard, practiced hand and eyes so flat they looked almost blank.

Then the corridor narrowed and split, the way tunnels did when they had no wish to be used for heroes.

"Split two to one," Bill called from left.

"No split now," Harry answered, more certain than he had any right to be. He could feel the compulsion still circling, not gone, and this was no longer his private battle. If he hesitated the wave would carry others.

"Stay together," he said. "Two pairs and one center."

Ron, at once irritated and relieved, moved to argue. "That’s not—"

"Do as I said," Harry snapped. It felt strange to hear himself give orders and not have to justify them. It also felt useful.

Arthur looked at him for half a second and then gave a tiny nod. "He’s right. Keep with him."

The tide came hard, and they took the turn together.

When the first line of the safe stair came above water, Harlan was there in the lip of smoke-white fog, not in command this time but trying still to stand inside a room that had stopped listening.

He had one of his men with him, the pelican gone quiet nearby. Harlan’s right shoulder showed a fresh bruise where Fred had hit him, and his breathing was louder than it should have been for a man who had thought himself untouchable.

His eyes were not on the children, nor on the water. They were on Voss.

Voss stood in deeper fog twenty feet away and looked as if he had misjudged not the spell but the length of the room. His mouth twitched once in frustration, not at his men. At Harry, perhaps. At the tide. At Arthur. Hard to know.

He raised his wand-holding hand, though there was no wand in it now.

"You think this is over," he said, as if speaking to an old colleague after a meeting.

Arthur did not dignify it with one long answer. He pointed at the BMA officers, then at Harlan, then at the wave line that had almost reached the second line of anchor stones. "Take both of them," he said to the nearest officers. "No spell escalation. No room for injuries, no room for arguments."

One of the officers swallowed and nodded. The other hesitated and said, "Can’t be done in one hold without a force pin." 

"Then do what’s legal," Tomo said from the side, voice like flint under wet cloth. "He is in custody for conspiracy and public danger. We have witness and sequence. Bind the men first, then the senior actor."

Harlan jerked. "You don’t understand this city, witch."

The youngest BMA officer did not look at him. She looked at Arthur and saw in him exactly what command needed to sound like concern.

"You understand this moment," she said, and in that second she got a line from Tomo around the man and around his knees.

No one celebrated. They didn’t yet. The tide did a second time against the lower ribs of the tunnel and this time it seemed to be arguing with every ward stone as if each were old and weak and tired of argument.

Bill signalled from his side.

"If we hold him and don’t move now, we lose the side channel." He kept shouting over the surge. "If we lose side channel we lose the children in transit."

Arthur moved with a speed Harry had only seen from him when he was teaching a stubborn bolt of enchantment to do less than it wanted.

"We can’t lose anything else,” Arthur said. “We go in sequence.”

Sequence.

He had said it earlier in the chapter that ended with them climbing stairs. Now it meant something else.

Molly got Ron, Ginny, and Marisol through the final turn and then pulled Harry’s sleeve once, hard enough that he felt it through damp cloth.

"Count your own breaths," she said. “You’re not alone in this one.”

That was the moment Harry understood the compulsion had not been just on him. It had been designed to peel people apart. To isolate. To turn fear inward and make each person a room. He had held to the thought of home not because it was comforting but because it gave him a shape larger than a spell. He kept to it through the final steps and did not let the wave see one single person in him.

They emerged into the side chamber two levels up, where the air changed from wet-stone and iron to old dust and lamp oil.

Bill shut a final counter-ward with an exhausted look and not a dramatic motion. Tomo followed with a ring pattern at his shoulder. Gus stood waiting with three ward lamps and one black satchel of sealing resin.

The sea hissed behind them.

Arthur dropped to one knee, breathing heavily, and put one hand to his side where a line of blue had gone white-gray by the strain. Harry almost reached to help him and then stopped because Arthur did not need another hand; he needed one more minute to stay in the room where command still had the shape of a father.

“Everyone accounted?” Bill called.

Tomo counted.

“Children yes. Fred, George, Marisol, Ron, Ginny, Harry. Adult: Arthur, Bill, me. Two enemy detained. One enemy missing—Voss not in this line yet.”

From behind them, Voss stepped forward.

He had moved as if he could still make people gather by intention, but no one followed his shape. He walked with a carefulness that betrayed his age and no longer his certainty.

“Not detained?” he said.

Arthur did not answer. He nodded at the officers and they took two measured steps forward.

Harlan spat a hard line into the wet floor and then laughed without humor. “You think this buys anything?”

No one did not hear him. They heard Voss first.

"I did not create the compulsion," Harlan said, as if that made the whole thing his invention. "You are lucky the room collapsed in the way it did. You’re lucky there was a tide. I would have—"

A second officer touched Voss’s wrist with a ringed band and a soft blue light held it there.

The band clicked like a tiny lock.

"Voss stays where I can keep an eye on him," Arthur said. He did not use the name. He did not call him sir. He had no title to offer for what had happened.

Voss made a soft noise of distaste.

He looked at Harry just once before the line held him. The expression was not pity, not triumph, not even regret. It was a final and deeply personal disappointment, as if Harry had failed some private test and the failure had gone undiscussed.

Then the binding ring flashed and he was still.

The officers did the same to Harlan.

By the time the room was sealed enough to count again, people had names for each other and no names for what had nearly happened. That was sometimes how victory looked.

Tomo released a breath that might have been a laugh. “If this had been any slower, we’d have drowned everyone between these anchors,” she said.

Bill managed a half-grin and the look of a man who had survived an entire evening and did not yet trust joy.

“We have to hear it all at dawn,” Tomo said, moving to write down names. “BMA forms are not going to fill themselves. Isolde is being held separate for now. I need her statement before she goes quiet out of shame or fear.”

Arthur held up a hand and the room did not need him to shout.

“Isolde will come under our protection if she tells us what to expect. If she stays silent, she still gets a hearing. I’m not offering her a favor; I’m offering us a city.”

Tomo nodded. “You’re right. A clean corridor, then custody notes. And once this is done we start the re-ward.”

“Hush,” Molly said, kneeling to rub warm hands over Harry’s face and Ginny’s. “No one talks like that so early in the morning. You want to speak, speak in tea first.”

Ron made a sound that was nearly a snort.

Molly gave him a look.

“Drink,” she said.

He drank.

No one was given more than two sips of tea before movement resumed.

The tunnel and its dead corridors still needed closure, and with that, they all returned to the rhythm that had carried them this long: find the next task before the fear gets too much room.

---

The BMA field office had already moved into the upper fog lanes by sunrise.

The room was practical rather than impressive, a converted cellar with a bell and enough forms to make three clerks look useful. Voss and Harlan were both sat already on metal benches, wrists marked and wrists quiet now. Tomo signed the transport order and told the inspector the city had just survived an attempt at compulsion at civic scale.

Arthur, Bill, and Tomo entered first; Harry stayed close, because leaving that room would have felt like leaving school before assembly finished.

Tomo’s words were plain and fast. "Both have custody and both remain available for questioning in sequence." The inspector looked at her, then at the cane fragment with the false-warded slot still threaded through it, and at the resin seals from the lower tunnels." That gets me where I want to be," she said.

"Is there full compulsion evidence?" she asked.
"On Harry and the children. Multiple nodes. We can give you sequence windows and witness maps," Tomo said." Keep the sequence clean and this city keeps its next few years."

Arthur added,"Write the wave itself, not the theory. We need every person who cast and every person who stood still because they were trying not to obey."

A clerk led Isolde in from a side passage. She came without ceremony, coat still damp, hands marked by potion glass. For a moment everyone made space without being told to."I did not finish the final matrix," she said, voice steady." I saw the children in the room and stopped at the last step. That does not absolve me. It merely gives this city one less body to bury."

She handed over wrapped notes and ledgers."My records," she said, "and every line with my marks. Harlan’s procurement line is there. Voss never had a perfect chain, only a chain he believed justified."

Arthur’s face softened one inch and then closed again. "Thank you," he said. "Not for the past. For the door you left open this hour."


The inspector stamped the packet, passed one final question about names, then signaled for transport. Harlan went first, then Voss, each restrained the same way and watched by two officers because no one wanted a last improvisation in a public room.

When the first bound door closed behind Voss, Harry realized how little noise was required to claim victory. Fear had had its room. The city did not have to like it. It only had to survive.

Arthur put a hand on his shoulder as the others rejoined. "You gave the room one minute." Harry nodded."That was all it needed."

---

By noon, Fog Hollow had a new sound.

No bells, no alarms, no distant compulsion murmurs under the bridges. It had the sound of people learning a city had nearly gone missing and deciding to keep the rest of it alive.

Gus had spread his tools across the broad table in what had once been a card-printing cellar near the sea-facing stairs. Tomo had three maps and a pair of iron rods from the old ministry stores. Bill was there with his own set of ward schematics, and even though he looked as if he had been cut down and stitched back up twice already, he moved with the calm of a man who had made more careful repairs.

Outside, Muggle trucks passed with ordinary engine noise, and the lane had that normality that only appears once everyone in it has agreed to keep secrets and keep people safe.

Gus called it “a clean beginning.”

Arthur called it “a chance not to be clever.”

Bill called it “fifty-three hours to prevent a structural backwash.”

Tomo called it “a sequence.”

The three words had no argument in them.

On the table was the first of the re-warding components: powdered glass from an old sinker line, three lengths of storm-hardened copper wire, resin infused with the sort of salt that carried no taste for ordinary men, and the copy of Eileen Ferreira’s notes that Gus had nearly lost when the old records burned in the warehouse fire.

He laid them down with hands that had seen too many funerals and too many repairs.

“Eileen marked each station with a family rhythm,” he said to Arthur, then repeated to Harry because he had decided this boy was no longer only a witness. “Not with names. With habits. She knew wards hold better when the people around them have to decide things together. We can recite equations. But this line only listens if we stop pretending we are alone.”

Harry listened, and suddenly the old city noise seemed to stand apart like another family in the room.

“Start with the first line at the east lip,” Tomo said, and held the rod over the map as if she had written it by hand on invisible stone.

Gus nodded. “That is where they weakened first.”

“Which is where your old enemy hoped to start breathing again,” Bill said.

Tomo said, “No enemies. Voss is in custody. Harlan is in custody. What we have now is a wound.”

Arthur set a marker. “Then mend the wound.”

They worked for an hour that felt too short for what it carried.

Molly arrived with baskets and tea, and she had three arguments in her face before she began serving.

“No one touches the potions without marking it,” she said.

“Already done,” Tomo said.

“Then don’t drink everything before it sets,” Molly said.

Fred and George appeared in the doorway and one more pair of eyes than they had before.

“We found a way to make your lines hum,” said George, pointing to a packet of improvised insulation they had brought from the twins’ bag.

Ron gave him a look that was equal parts distrust and gratitude.

“You are not to cast on active wards,” Arthur said at once. “This is not the time for your inventions.”

“Not cast,” George said quickly. “Only test resistance with two sparks no larger than a candle and one loud word.”

“I can do that for confidence,” said Bill, and he set aside his quill to inspect the thing they had made.

“It does a different thing on one line,” said George. “Not enough to break anything.”

Gus turned the little thing over once and then laughed despite the urgency. “You boys keep making city-sized things out of impossible little trouble.”

“Your city-sized thing came to a point where we all nearly got soaked,” Fred said.

“That is history,” Gus said.

The laughter was short and true and then over.

By late afternoon, Anchor One had a second layer and the east seam had the first of the new wards sealed. Tomo worked with red ink and a concentration that kept no room for chatter. Bill had his hands in the marks and his jaw set in the way Harry recognized from his own best chess-game concentration in first-year studies, except this was a game with a roomful of children under it. Arthur moved between tables not because anyone asked for him but because no one else knew when to keep moving and when not to.

The tide rose once more behind the sealed stone and then withdrew, not by mercy but because the old locks were closed properly and everyone remembered what they were trying to prevent.

At the final anchor, Gus paused with the marker above stone and looked at his sonless, inherited memory of his wife.

“She never did it the easy way,” he said quietly. “She used whatever she had to make people answerable to one another. If this city is lucky, it will be a place where she can still be wrong and still forgiven. That’s what wards should be for.”

Arthur gave him a look that said he understood because he, too, had spent his life in rooms where systems did what they could and no one was watching. Bill, not quite sure what to do with a sentence like that, put a hand on Gus’s arm.

“Your wife did the city a gift,” Bill said. “We are trying to return it.”

Outside the cellar, the light changed as it does in San Francisco near sunset, when everything gets a thin edge of gold no one can defend from.

“Good,” said Molly from the doorway. “No one says the tea is cold before they drink it and realize you may have work till evening.”

Nobody minded being rebuked. Nobody minded anyone.

---

The final day settled in as if the city had finally learned to stop arguing.

San Francisco can do that, if you have survived a single week of its weather. It will stop looking at you for one clear hour and let you believe you are somewhere that belongs to you.

By morning the family had begun the difficult task of undoing joy.

Clothes were folded with the kind of care usually reserved for gifts that did not belong to one room only. Cards were written. Tickets were checked twice. Herb and spice scents from Muggle bakeries crossed the air with old salt and old wet rope from a port truck. The fog had lifted enough to show bridges and roofs and the old line of hills at the edge of the city.

They visited all of what mattered to them in exactly the wrong order, as families always do when saying goodbye.

They went first to the Sourdough Cauldron because Molly refused to leave a place of rescue unfed. Gus met them there in a rolled coat, face already carrying the new lines of work and old mourning.

He had his kettle boiling, and on the sideboard a pan of small biscuits sat warm enough to smell of butter and cinnamon.

“Nothing like good bread before leaving,” he said, as if this were ordinary and not the end of a war.

Harry had not thought of bread in this town before chapter twelve. He thought of Molly’s scones. He thought of Harry’s childhood where bread was measured in insults. Here it felt like a kindness with no condition.

Arthur took one biscuit and set it down, then took another for Harry before he could ask. Molly pretended to scold him for feeding the whole party before noon.

“Someone has to prove you can still be normal,” she said.

Arthur said, “I am fully capable of one normal thing now.”

Molly raised an eyebrow.

“Prove it.”

Ginny, who had not talked much at the table, smiled in a way she had not used often, and it was exactly enough to make Harry think this city had finally given him one more home.

From there they moved through Fog Hollow’s lanes with no hurry and everyone pretending the route was not a farewell route. Marisol walked ahead and then behind, translating the ordinary and the impossible with that effortless tone she used when she was trying not to cry. She pointed to a corner and said, “New sign here. It’s legal now.” She pointed to a stack of crates and said, “That’s legal enough.” She pointed to a doorway and said, “Not legal enough. Don’t go there even if you miss us.”

It sounded like jokes because that is what teenagers do when they are trying to keep other things from breaking.

At Pacifica Wands & Curios, Fred and George returned the key charm to the shopkeeper with a grin and a solemn tone.

“We still owe you three days to explain the fountain-pen spell that exploded into pink smoke,” George said.

The shopkeeper, who had never forgiven and never kept a score, considered them and said, “You got a refund. No one asked for apology. Consider this the city’s generosity.”

Fred leaned toward Harry and murmured, “In Fog Hollow, that means you survived two rounds.”

Harry laughed before he realized that he had forgotten what that felt like.

At the Coit side steps, Percy had already made a list on his own, neat and corrected twice, of final words to say to Tomo’s office about protocol and thanks and maybe some additional cautionary notes for any future case where children and compulsion came into play.

Bill stood with him while he attempted to behave like the older brother who had seen everything and still kept his voice calm.

“Don’t write me a memo,” Arthur said. “Write me a list of who owes us dinner.”

Percy almost smiled and then gave up, which made Harry want to hug him with a grin.

In the afternoon they visited Fisherman’s Wharf, partly because it was still open, partly because the kids needed a final burst of wind and noise to pretend they were not walking out of a room where danger had learned to speak clearly.

There were tourists. There were gulls. There were two children whose mother had packed sandwiches and two who had not packed anything but had already decided this was the moment to taste pretzels with too much salt. There was no one who believed fog could command memory.

Marisol found them a bench at the edge of the pier and put her palms on the rail.

“I hate saying this,” she said. “But you’ll be gone before this week has settled properly. The city forgets how loud it got after it gets calm.”

Fred squeezed her shoulder.

“We can forgive that,” he said.

Marisol frowned. “And if you forget where to send letters, you are not forgiven.”

She turned to Harry.

“To you,” she added, because she knew she had to say this to the right person, not everyone at once. “You write? I mean, properly write? You keep notes. You know, proper ones with ink and post. I want to see that the city stays a place where one can still be foolish and survive. Write to us. I’ll expect bad paper and worse spelling.”

Harry had no answer for the generosity built out of ordinary words.

“Promise?” she said.

He lifted his hand and then felt the whole summer in it.

“Yes,” he said. “I promise.”

She grinned, and for a second she looked exactly as she had when she first met him at the alley: bright as a city sign and dangerous in all the right ways.

“Good,” she said. “Then don’t become too British for it.”

“Too American for us already,” Fred said.

Marisol threw an imaginary cushion. “You are both not allowed to be unkind.”

The twins agreed without argument.

---

By evening the fog began to gather over the bridges.

Everyone had practical things left to do. Luggage had to be checked. Passports and Ministry documents had to be sealed in the same order as if their first day had never happened. Arthur had to settle final dues with the rental house. Bill had to leave a list for Tomo and Gus: which stone had held too long and which one sang under pressure. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had to convince themselves this was a good place for a family to be, even for the memory of it.

Harry walked with Ron along the lower edge of the bridge while the city turned gold and the fog turned pearl.

It could have been any city for a long moment. It could have been just bridge, fog, wind. But it could not be any city for the things packed into his jacket and in his chest.

Ron kept to the side and threw pebbles into water he could not see.

“Cheating,” Harry said, as if they were discussing Quidditch and not the last of something he had wanted and feared.

“Me?” Ron said. “I have a perfect aim, thank you.”

“Your aim is terrible when you’re trying to do anything honest,” Harry said.

Ron tossed another pebble and then stared down the line of cables. “You know what I’m thinking?” he said.

“No.”

“You know what I’m thinking, actually,” Ron said. “This is where we’ll come back to.”

“Come back when?” Harry asked.

Ron gave him the look he had used in the kitchens when he had hidden an insecurity and then accidentally dropped it. “When things are all said and done and we can afford to be excited about it.”

A gull cried overhead and went toward the east where the fog made the last light vanish into itself.

Harry said nothing for a while.

Below them the Pacific rolled its own steady argument against the city’s lights and won every time.

He had said the word once in the Underlook and it had steadied him. He said it again now because the city around him could have been one of those places that looked permanent only because everyone pretended it was.

Home.

He said it aloud once, then again without moving his lips.

At first it did not feel like his. It sounded borrowed, as if he were trying on an old coat of a sentence.

But then the word changed. It did not become grand. It became practical.

Home was not only where you went to bed. It was who kept count of your breaths when you forgot to count them yourself. It was Molly making him hold a tea cup because he looked like he would drop it and forgetting to make him feel guilty for needing that care. It was Arthur being impossible about a parking meter and then impossible about a child. It was Ginny making a line and not turning away from the dark in it.

And Marisol, with her impossible hair and impossible honesty, saying write to me. It was the first honest demand anyone had made in weeks that sounded like a kindness.

He and Ron walked the length of the bridge in silence until the last light had gone and the lights from the far side came on in a line that made the fog glow around them.

When they came back toward the car and the city, Marisol’s promise folded itself into the same breath as Molly’s call from the stair and the memory of Harry’s own voice answering Voss with one small, stubborn word.

He had resisted because he had something to hold. The city gave him that thing.

The fog moved over the bridge and made two families into one long, brief shadow.

At home, one city away and one world in a room, Harry would have to leave all that. He knew it. No story that teaches a boy where he belongs asks him to pretend it always stays.

But for this hour, as the cables hummed with the tide and sunset had sunk into blue, he was not a visitor from a cupboard and a map. He was a boy who had crossed two cities of fog and come through with more than warning and not less.

He whispered it one final time and kept it for himself.

Home.
