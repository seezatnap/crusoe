## Hook

By late morning the fog had thinned into a wet, reluctant veil that still clung to Brackwater’s edges and kept every chimney from owning its own smoke. The station office did not look changed since Pencombe had left it the day before, and that was precisely the kind of change that fooled people into trusting continuity.

On paper, continuity was now too simple: one dead doctor, one sealed room, one folded clinic note, a few confused bells.

On the board, it was not simple at all.

She stood before it with the station watch in one hand and a fresh sheet in the other. The watch had fogged the edge when she had touched it earlier; Vale had promised to send it for cleaning, as if that would make the hour kinder.

On the board were the same marks as yesterday:

- door keyhole paste marker from the Hallowford room,
- folded paper from Joe’s coat pocket,
- bell schedule drift,
- unresolved station log variance.

She was no longer drawing those marks as atmosphere. She was drawing them as a chain that had started to knot in one direction.

“The house gave us a clock,” she said, tapping the first pin. “But not one clock. Four clocks, and one key.”

Vale looked up from the ledger she had handed him when he entered the room.

“We have the station correction on tram route 5,” he said. “No emergency relay for the legal side at ten twenty-seven.”

“Read me the sequence.”

He read from his own notes and not from paper, which is how he always spoke when the facts were not yet safe to write.

“At twenty-two nineteen the church bell is logged as a double. By the lane watchman’s memo, only one. At twenty-two twenty-three, the station line says no response. At twenty-two thirty-two, tram board reports delay and reroute, but no missing barrel notation. At twenty-two fifty-eight, dispatch marks one correction request from a private call block with no signatory.”

Pencombe held the notes without looking.

“And our house witness says key and umbrella passed to corridor at ten-forty in the evening, with a packet to the corridor,” she said. “No one gave us a full chain since then. We need it from another angle.”

She moved her finger to the timeline spine on the board: CH-001, CH-002, CH-003.

“Today we pull the house apart by its hands. If a key left the board, somebody put it there and somebody moved it after.”

The rain in the window hissed and stopped. It was the station’s version of hesitation.

## Scene 1 — Pencombe’s Clock Reconstruction

The station board had three clocks now, all in disagreement like a room full of old men telling different versions of the same storm.

At ten minutes past nine, Pencombe and Vale had already taken Clara’s ledger notebook and the kitchen key inventory sheet and were in the old hall of Hallowford with a constable and two fresh sheets of lined paper.

“We do this in daylight,” Pencombe said, “while the house is still honest about what each room saw.”

The hall still held the smell of damp wool and wax, and Clara had just sent another tray through with untouched tea. The corridor had been scrubbed so thoroughly that anyone with a criminal conscience could feel the violence of neatness.

She chose the servants’ passage first because service routes tell their own lies. Service routes are where people move in routine and where routine breaks leave the clearest evidence.

Vale had the advantage of hands that remembered every hinge in the house. He had learned long ago that a house could lie less in its words and more in the friction of its screws.

“Stand by,” Pencombe said.

He opened the kitchen cabinet where spare keys were listed on a hook board for housework, firewood, pantry entries, and the side corridor at night.

“How many keys were on this board before we arrived?” she asked.

“Four in the row I know and one missing.” He held up the brass ring from the inventory and pointed at the empty space as if it were an accusation with no face.

Pencombe did not move immediately. She watched the house with a discipline that looked like dispassion and cost a city of thought.

“And the missing one?”

“No mark where it ought to be. If it was moved, the move was recent and deliberate. There’s a sheen on the screw where someone used compound to steady a hand.”

She looked at him, not at the board.

“Compound, or mud?”

Vale gave a short shrug.

“It is not dirt from pantry floor. It is the same green-black press of paste we saw on the study keyhole.”

Pencombe held the line a moment.

“Then we have C-010 active in the house.”

He looked almost surprised that she would put the label immediately.

“You are going to put that on the board?”

“Not as conclusion. As pressure.”

She wrote on her paper:

**C-010 — kitchen side key not returned to its registered hook at the scheduled hour; transfer residue resembles controlled keywork handling.**

Next she sent two constables to mark corridor lengths, then took the inventory ledger from Clara’s hand and laid it out on the hall table. The paper was cheap and thick in the way only working women’s books are: meant to survive both rain and blame.

“Who writes this?”

Clara answered from the hallway where she had remained, as if she had expected to be judged for every sentence she had already given.

“I do. For keys, coal, milk, coal, and night lamps.”

“Do you keep separate entries for corridor movements?”

“Only when the movements leave a mark.”

“Then that is your next line,” Pencombe said. “Show me all lines marked for after ten.”

Clara laid a hand on the page.

“I should not have been asked this long before.”

Pencombe did not soften.

“You were asked, and no one asked with this much consequence.”

There were three columns: hour mark, station, object. Two marks were neat. One line was smudged with a thumb edge where a page had been pressed and then corrected.

Clara read the marks aloud.

“10:30 — sideboard key, umbrella noted.  
10:43 — corridor lamp inspected, no replacement.  
11:12 — kitchen bell unanswered by bellboy, no action.  
11:47 — coal room soot check, key return due.”  

She stopped. Her voice had no certainty and no rehearsal.

Pencombe nodded slowly.

“What is missing from this?”

Clara looked toward the hall as though it had an ear.

“I left the return field blank there. On purpose, perhaps. I was not sure the room was not still within my care.”

“Why?”

“Because I had one message in that half hour that did not belong to the house and I did not want to write every line.”

Vale took a step forward.

“What message?”

“The same one as yesterday,” Pencombe said. “Not now.”

She asked instead, “Do you have the page where line 11:47 would have been made?”

Clara opened her notebook again and showed a lower segment where no hour was written, only one bent mark like a nail on wet paper.

“That,” Pencombe said, “is exactly what we are here for.”

The missing line became immediate pressure. She marked it.

“Clara, if we keep this in sequence, we have one possible break in routine between corridor and key return. We are not accusing yet. We are fixing facts with fewer names than we used to.”

Clara swallowed.

“You want to know if I wrote nothing that should have been written.”

Pencombe sat down on the edge of the hall table and spoke to her as if they were in the same room in the same fog.

“Yes.”

She folded her arms.

“Then write this one for me.”

Clara held out the pen.

“I can’t write if I am not certain.”

Pencombe gave one thin, dry smile.

“Certainty is what we make from you and this page. Write uncertainty. Then we will test it.”

The house waited while Clara wrote line 11:47 in tiny script: *key return unchecked*.

The sentence was no confession. It was a hinge.

In that hinge Pencombe saw two consequences at once. First, a household movement had gone unlogged. Second, the unlogged window now matched Vale’s earlier residue on the kitchen hook and the station’s clock drift.

There was no proof of intrusion yet. There was proof of administrative pressure inside the house during the hour before death.

She moved to the corridor map and asked for a final sequence from 10:30 to 11:50, with each location, each object, each person to speak if present.

“We can use this to decide whether this is memory error,” she said, “or custody error.”

Then she made room on the board with a hard horizontal line.

**Working Hypothesis (non-final): Key leaves sideboard route under routine pretext and returns late enough to affect corridor integrity.**

“That is no one’s accusation,” she said. “That is what the house would look like if one key did not obey habit.”

Vale glanced at the key-hook again.

“And if habit was only an excuse.”

Pencombe gave him no answer, only the nod that means she has decided what the next hour must answer.

## Scene 2 — Clara Bell’s Ledger

Clara Bell stood in the small service office with both hands flat on the table when Pencombe returned later with paper. She had a habit, Pencombe had noticed, of pressing her hands together before a difficult truth, as if to keep herself from splitting.

No interrogation happened at once. Pencombe gave her tea and asked for a full day’s sequence: who moved from pantry to corridor to side passage and back.

“I served that house for fifteen years,” Clara said quietly. “Routine is my first loyalty.”

“I need your routine now,” Pencombe replied.

The two women sat beneath the light that gave everything an amber patience. Pencombe did not ask for signatures first. She asked for sequence.

“Start at nine.”

Clara looked at the ledger again.

“At nine, Margaret dismissed me from the side hall because she had letters to settle and wanted no one standing in the way. That is ordinary. At nine twelve, I checked the coal room and sent the boy out for ash.”

Pencombe wrote.

“At nine thirty, who took the sideboard key?”

Clara did not answer immediately.

“Dr. Hale asked for the study key and an umbrella,” she said at last.

“And who saw him?”

“I did. The house boy did not. She saw him.” She meant Margaret.

Pencombe kept her tone practical.

“From your point of view, when was the key returned?”

“By twelve it had no place to go if he had returned it,” Clara said. “Not to the sideboard, not to the kitchen hook, not to the night tray key chest.”

She turned her eyes to the wall where a small clock swung and no longer trusted any clock.

“You wrote 11:47 as key return due,” Pencombe said.

Clara winced.

“You found that line.”

“I need when that line stopped being uncertain.”

“That was at ten fifty-two,” Clara said, and spoke to the woodgrain itself.

“Who gave you the paper packet then?”

“Not I. I only moved what it asked.”

Pencombe did not move faster than the room would allow.

“What asked?”

Clara closed her eyes for a moment.

“A runner from the lane with a folded paper packet under the arm. Medicine paper, I think. Could be ledger paper, but you know this house and you know paper has habits.”

“Medicine paper?”

“Folded like Saint Jude’s packets, with no wax but a hard crease. It did not smell like medicine to me. It smelled of wool and lamp smoke.”

“And this happened after the key should have been returned?”

“At that hour yes. I should have logged it. I did not. I told myself it was not for me.”

Vale’s pen paused at the edge of her ledger line, then resumed.

Pencombe asked, “Who did you tell?”

“No one. Then Margaret called and asked for the house bells; she was already late. Evelyn was not yet home. I thought a folded packet was not a claim.”

“A folded packet is a claim.”

Clara turned to her. “You are right.”

Pencombe let that sentence settle and then asked for the kitchen-side board.

“Where was the key kept when you moved it?”

“Side corridor stand for half an hour, then kitchen hook.”

“You just wrote sideboard key at ten thirty.”

“Yes.”

“And now you say side corridor to kitchen hook? That is two stations.”

“The sideboard key did not go straight home.”

Pencombe nodded once, and the air between them shifted.

“Who had the key chain then?”

“Me, first. Then one of the senior boys from the lane, maybe to test if the corridor light needed new glass. I did not want to block him if it was service.”

“Why no name?”

“Because he spoke as if he had already been told not to be named.”

“Did he have a legal voice to ask that?”

Clara gave a short, dry laugh without joy.

“A legal voice sounds like authority. There is only one voice in this house that can make a legal voice and remain polite.”

Pencombe held up her hand.

“I did not ask you to accuse. I asked you for sequence.”

“You cannot ask for a sequence and then ask for names in one line,” Clara said. “You have to live this way and I am not built to do that with one breath.”

The room gave them a brief mercy. The silence around that line was exactly what made Pencombe trust it: if the whole woman was rehearsed, she would have answered with names then.

The conversation moved to the key ring itself. Clara drew the inventory ring from her pocket and turned it over. There were four ring marks and one faint crescent of blackened paste near the hinge slot.

“I noticed this yesterday,” Pencombe said.

“So did I,” Clara answered. “That is why I kept it separate.”

“You kept this ring separate.”

“Because any key touched on the wrong evening gets its own accounting,” Clara said. “You ask me about truth. This house teaches truth in objects first.”

Pencombe slid the ring under a desk lamp and made a note she would later turn into evidence.

**C-009 candidate: domestic ledger includes a missing household inventory entry under the key-return line; the omitted line corresponds with service corridor activity around the same interval as household claims.**

Then she asked the question that would either reopen the house or close it.

“Did anyone see another person in the corridor after the key was first moved?”

Clara’s mouth closed, then opened.

“A person at the corridor stair landing at half past eleven. Tall. Coat not one of ours. Coat with a narrow left cuff and a right hand darker than the lamp.”

Vale looked up, and then gave no reaction.

“A hand colour note,” Pencombe repeated.

“I only remember because the landing glass had one of those gas-blue reflections. If it is true, this was not a servant passing a message.”

Pencombe asked, “How long?”

“A minute or less. Then no sound.”

“No sound is not small when bells are expected,” Pencombe said.

Clara nodded.

“And at eleven, I wrote one of the ledger lines and left a gap. I thought it was a delay. I was wrong.”

Pencombe didn’t ask if she was wrong by omission or protection. She was not here to absolve or condemn, only to align.

“You have given us one sequence that can be tested,” Pencombe said. “The key moved, the key-hold interval was long, and corridor presence was observed. That is enough for us.”

She wrote a second line.

**C-009 in progress: line-level omission in Clara’s ledger indicates a service corridor movement not fully recorded at the expected key return time.**

Clara touched her notebook again and then spoke to her own record, not Pencombe.

“I wrote that line wrong because I did not know it mattered.”

“People rarely know what matters until a room proves them wrong,” Pencombe said softly.

Then she asked for one last detail.

“Did he return the key?”

“No,” Clara answered at last and the answer did not sound rehearsed. “Not before dawn.”

“To whom?”

Clara looked up at the hall clock and then at Pencombe.

“I do not know. The key may have been passed on before the house had a chance to remember it.”  

No more answers came quickly. Pencombe let the statement complete itself.

The household sequence had become a pattern of omitted lines and borrowed time, and that, for Pencombe, was more useful than any dramatic confession. She thanked Clara, not for helping them, but for forcing the chapter’s shape.

Outside, the rain had turned again to a fine film on the panes, as if the sky wanted the ledger to blur while it could.

## Scene 3 — Vale and the Soot Line

From there Vale and two officers walked the house in silence until the kitchen corridor, where even silence had to account for itself.

Vale kept the station board folded and did not keep looking at it. He had learned to trust a house more than a page for the first ten minutes.

“You do as you’re told,” Pencombe had said earlier, and he had done so.

He found the missing key mark first where people never expect it: beside the wall of the fire-room in the old coal anteroom, near a brass strip where a hand had braced against soot while passing a key.

It was not a heavy smudge.

It was a line. Not thick. A line where a palm brushed soot downward and then cut off abruptly. Clean enough to show that whatever passed had stopped and moved on.

Vale knelt and looked for height.

The line was at mid-crotch level, not at floor level. An adult had leaned. A hurried adult, carrying either a small object or a wrapped packet.

“This is C-011 candidate,” he muttered without voice and reached for his notebook.

Pencombe arrived two minutes later and stood in the doorway while he worked.

“You have it?”

“Soot line from fire-room threshold to corridor edge. A hand passed, brief, at the same rough hour Clara leaves blank.”

“Direction?”

“From stair corridor into fire room and back. Not a full pass through. Could be a check, could be concealment transfer.”

“Could be the person from her window reflection.”

Vale nodded once and traced the line’s arc with a gloved finger. “At least one person bent low and used right-hand pressure while holding a narrow packet. No broad shoulder sweep. No lantern drag.”

He took a swab cloth, but not on the soot.

“We do this with custody only,” he said. “No contamination.”

“Good.” She nodded.

He pointed to the wall by the fireplace where the soot had lifted in a crescent.

“Not key print, not boot print, but this line repeated at two heights. One lower from the first hand, one just higher near the third key hook point.”

“What does that mean?”

“One person passed twice.”

“Same person?”

Vale shook his head.

“Not proven. Could be the same hand passing quickly and then returning with a tool or key to avoid leaving two prints in one place. Could be two persons with careful timing. But if two, then someone copied the first movement.”

He moved to the kitchen key board and held his palm open.

The missing key had left no scratch. That meant whoever moved it did not drag it along metal.

“No hook mark?”

“Correct. It was lifted and replaced cleanly. That is either careful staff or someone with practiced handling.”

Pencombe looked at the wall again.

“Careful handling and urgent passage.”

Vale nodded.

He found another clue along the corridor skirting: a narrow dark line on the banister edge. It was as thin as a pencil but too hard in tone to be weather.

“Paste transfer?”

“Like wax-catch on metal contact,” Pencombe said.

Vale rubbed it with cloth.

“Still the same family as C-002 and C-010. Controlled handling.”

He moved to the service stair where Clara had said she had briefly seen movement and found no full print.

The stairs still smelled of wet wool, and one step had a faint oil patch at the edge.

“From where?”

“Possibly carriage dressing oil,” Vale said. “Possibly lamp bracket. The shape is too small for a trunk.”

Pencombe did not ask until he offered his own chain.

“Any sign of packet handling?”

“At three inches above the tread: a straight transfer arc from key in left to something in right. I can’t call it packet residue yet.”

He turned on the board of the house. “If the household claims a single corridor crossing, and you had two key hooks touched with controlled residue, then the corridor had two meaningful uses.”

Pencombe gave the same look she reserved for good evidence.

“And the soot line means one of those uses ended in the fire room.”

Vale nodded.

“That room had a draft. Anyone passing at a private hour would pass low there and then out.”

She asked him to mark one final point.

“Who else has access to this corridor with a legal pretense?”

Vale did not answer with names. He gave structure.

“Housekeeper, two kitchen hands, one carriage man, and whoever carries the service key ring. Which last one you must identify.”

“And if the last one used a temporary key chain?”

“Then C-010 remains the cleanest signal: key did not return to expected hook in real time.”

He walked to the hall desk and looked at the key ring as if he could still hear key weight.

“This is the first scene where the house itself gave us a method and not merely testimony,” he said.

Pencombe nodded.

“Write that. In full.”

He wrote in thick shorthand:

- C-010 confirmed by physical keyboard residue; the key line has controlled handling marks and late return.
- C-011 probable corridor-to-fire-room passage at late hour; mark suggests brief crossing and low-profile handling.
- Domestic line C-009 not yet fully reconciled; ledger omission has a material spatial residue.

“Where did this lead?” she asked.

“Wherever the key was carried after it left that hook.”

“Which is not yet written,” she said, looking at him.

He nodded. “Which is exactly why we have to keep the board open.”

## Scene 4 — Pencombe vs. the External Registers

By mid-afternoon the city had cleared again, if only enough for light to show the grime at the edges. Pencombe took the house data back to the station and made room for three external records at once: tram office call-sheet, bell-office correction memo, and the dispatch line from the private lane office.

The board looked less like an office and more like a weather map.

“We begin with the house route,” she told Vale.

He slid the key movement sheet next to tram prints.

“What do we see?”

“No one route can carry all the claims,” Pencombe said. “But one does explain the gap.”

She marked the corridor key movement as if it were an arrival and wrote a chain under it:

`22:30 (possible lane call)` → `10:43 claimed return window` → `11:47 key return due` → `11:47–11:58 blank` → `tram delay corridor` → `fire-room soot line`

She had written in station notebook: “No one witness is wrong about this entire house. They are all wrong within one short gap.”

The tram office memo arrived with a blot of damp ink.

At 22:47 one trolley car had departed late but on route; at 23:00 another car had rerouted. The city had a record line for one unlisted late rider in the service lane near Old Observatory route.

Pencombe tapped that line.

“Do we have witness for any servant on this lane?”

“No house rider log,” Vale said.

“Do we have a key route that matches?”

She raised a question back from the station book.

“Margaret said key taken at 22:30 by her husband. Clara says unlogged corridor event near 23:00. If a service key was used to cross that lane, someone is using an authorized corridor and an unauthorized hand.”

Then she pulled the bell office correction paper. It had a notation:

`Lane bell rung twice at corridor post, interval unresolved; corrected to one at final copy by station desk`

“Correction at final copy can erase one half-hour as noise,” she said. “But we are not correcting for people.”

“What about the external line you wanted?”

“From the lane line office,” Vale said. “They will not admit it by name.”

She looked up.

“Do we need names?”

“Not yet,” he said. “But we need the route time.”

“Then we make one route time now.” She made no dramatic pause. “The house key did not remain stationary. The key left routine after study access and returned after the lane correction window.”

She turned to the station telegraph box.

“Any messages?” she asked.

The operator at the desk gave a reluctant smile and said there was no official one that should move this case forward.

“No official records means no official convenience,” she said. “Where there is no record, we use inference and witness, not fantasy.”

She asked for one final check: whether the fire-room soot line and missing hook key had an object mark from the same hand. Vale asked two men to photograph and sketch marks in the old ledger room register.

As she reviewed the sketches, she found the same short crescent near a side key line she had seen at the clinic access door earlier. She had stopped looking for patterns at that point; now pattern arrived uninvited.

“Vale,” she said quietly, “we have an intersection from three points: domestic key return, corridor hand movement, and tram correction. They don’t give us a culprit. They give us a map of what must be reconstructed by dawn.”

He listened and did what he always did when a deduction was made clean.

“And the next map point?”

“No one in-house should be able to tell us the key’s legal owner if the chain was cut after sideboard. We need confirmation of who held temporary service access around midnight and who touched the corridor after the corridor note.”

She moved to the board and drew the next line.

`C-009: missing domestic ledger entry`  
`C-010: key return not recorded`  
`C-011: corridor/soot passage`

Below she wrote:

**Constraint: one missing minute-range route likely links household key custody to clinic access method.**

No one spoke for several breaths. The station clock then made a false cough and settled.

Then Pencombe reached for the station telephone and called the fire-room watch key master.

“Did either gate key or corridor key leave service inventory before dawn?” she asked.

“No one who signed was on the roster,” came the reply.

“No signature.” She wrote it down. “That gives us our first convergent point. We are no longer arguing over who misremembered. We are proving what a signed record omitted.”

When she hung up, she looked once at the board and then at Vale.

“The house has now given us three hard things: no recorded key return, an unlogged movement, and a passage line in the fire-room.”

He nodded as if he had already accepted his next dispatch order.

“I can send a team back to the lane and the service quarter. We’ll check who had corridor authority in this window.”

“Do it,” she said. “And tell them we are looking for people who can hold a key without signing their names. That includes men with legal manners and men with practical manners.”

He gave her that tiny nod again.

“And Clara?”

She gave him the same look she gave all useful people when the case changed shape.

“You need to protect what she gave us without giving her the blame for it,” she said. “She admitted omission. That is different from deception.”

Vale nodded.

“Then we move for the next chapter with two tasks: service custody verification and key impression comparison.”

Pencombe went to the door with her notebook already open.

“One more thing,” she said to no one in particular. “Tomorrow we test whether this blank in the ledger was simply a fear and not an intention. If it was fear, it will still leave a key.”

The office seemed suddenly less like a room and more like the first of many rooms she would have to open.

On her way out she wrote the final sentence for the day on her board:

**Inaccessibility is now not a statement about the room. It is a statement about custody, and custody has a timestamp.**

Outside, Brackwater was moving again under gray weather. Somewhere in town a tram bell struck and then stopped halfway through its ring, as though the city itself had begun counting in the same tense rhythm as the board.

## Clues & Revelations

- **C-009**: Clara Bell’s domestic inventory/ledger sequence contains a missing or blank key-return entry at the expected key-handling interval; her statement now links this omission to corridor activity after ten and before dawn.
- **C-010**: The kitchen key-hook and side passage trace suggest a key left its scheduled location and was handled with controlled residue, matching the controlled-access pattern already seen in CH-001/CH-002.
- **C-011**: A brief soot line in the fire-room threshold indicates a concealed late-hour corridor passage and suggests additional hand activity at the house’s service edge during the key-return gap.
- **C-005/C-010 interaction**: The revised household reconstruction still supports the earlier external clock mismatch but now narrows a specific corridor interval for re-check.
- **Architectural advance**: The puzzle shifts from “what happened in the locked room?” to “which lawful custody path failed between key movement and record integrity.” This strengthens the access architecture branch without fixing blame.

## Continuity Notes

- Scene order now follows `DOC-004` for Chapter 4: scene-by-scene: investigative reconstruction, key-focused domestic account, physical corridor sweep, external register cross-check.
- Timeline continuity from `DOC-006`: this chapter operationalizes `T-007`, extending the house-route correction with a specific domestic interval and key-return gap.
- Key POV continuity holds:  
  - Scene 1 and Scene 4: Inspector Pencombe (procedural control, timeline discipline).  
  - Scene 2: Clara Bell (domestic precision and omission under pressure).  
  - Scene 3: Sergeant Vale (spatial and tactile confirmation).
- Evidence continuity: C-002 and C-005 threads remain unresolved but now constrained by a concrete key-custody route with house-level corroboration.
- Character continuity: Clara remains cautious but observably factual; Pencombe retains inference discipline and does not overstate from limited marks; Vale remains kinetic and materially grounded.
- Open continuity risks: identity of the unnamed corridor figure and whether temporary key authority was internal or externally authorized remain unresolved.
- Immediate continuity handoff requirement to CH-005: any narrative of theater alibi now rests on a tightened domestic window, not just social testimony.

## Draft Log

- Drafted `CH-004-claras-clock.md` with chapter target structure and progression aligned to `DOC-004` and `DOC-005`.
- Deepened the investigative thread by tightening domestic key custody, corridor passage residue, and external tram/bell reconciliation.
- Advanced mystery-architecture constraints by connecting household chronology to access integrity rather than moving toward motive conclusions.
- Next required pass: exact word-count correction in `writing-artifacts/word-count.md`; post-mortem continuity pass against `DOC-006` thread T-007 before Chapter 5 handoff.
