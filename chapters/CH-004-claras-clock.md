## Hook

The lane clock at Saint Jude’s struck eight as a dull, late note, and Brackwater answered with fog thick enough to blunt the sound.

In the kitchen at Hallowford House, the fire burned with the discipline of a watch: never bright, never quite dark, always enough to make numbers look less certain on the table where Clara Bell had spread her accounts.

Pencombe stood at the threshold while Vale held the door wide with one shoulder and gave the room enough distance to decide whether it might yet contain a clean version of the truth.

The room itself moved like a held breath. Tea steamed on a tray no hand had touched for an hour. A ladle hung above the stove and looked as useful as a weapon. The wall clock had been polished so often it reflected the lamplight in a clean crescent, and all three hands pointed to 8:10 while the station clock below the lintel in the hall still held 8:03.

There were practical ways to read this contradiction. There were also ways to turn them into a story.

Pencombe set her hat aside and looked at Clara directly, not unkindly.

“You may start at six,” she said.

Clara nodded once and moved her eyes to the ledger, where the ink of one line had been scraped thin and then darkened by fresh hand pressure.

Vale heard one bell in the lane and another from the tram route at the same instant. The bells were not synchronised; they had never been since the fog this week thickened. Pencombe treated that fact as a witness and a warning both.

## Scene 1 — The Kitchen Ledger

Clara brought three books to the table, each one with a different promise and a different risk.

The first was the formal house ledger.
The second was the private key inventory.
The third had no heading at all, only a narrow strip of ruled paper pinned by a blue kitchen pin.

Pencombe knew to call the first book public, the second practical, the third confession.

She sat in the high chair, pen in hand, and tapped the lamp so the flame settled to a narrower brightness.

“Take the first hour after supper,” she said. “From half past ten to half past eleven. What was moved where.”

Clara’s fingers went to the domestic rhythm first, not the suspect’s face.

“Dinners were cleared by ten,” she said. “The nurse’s tray at the service room. Then the fire-room coal at ten twenty, because the room cools when the mist comes.”

Pencombe wrote each line. She did not look up for the first six answers, only asked for verbs.

“Who entered from corridor C?”

“Only house staff.”

“Name?”

“Beatrice, then I. The second entry was mine by your count.”

“Why no time on the first entry?”

Clara paused, then looked at her own private strip and pointed.

“Because I was not sure if it was a staff task or family task,” she said. “No one writes down care at that hour if it is not questioned.”

Pencombe nodded and leaned forward.

“The question is exactly why.”

The house smelled of onions gone cold. Pencombe kept the phrase and waited. She had learned in this city that waiting sometimes makes witnesses choose one truth before they defend two.

Clara turned the formal ledger and read the row for 22:30. She did not pretend to read it from memory; she read from the page with the thumb, as if the page itself had teeth.

“22:32 — kitchen fire checked; bell at top landing not required.”

“Which bell?”

“No bell; it is a note.” Clara gestured to the third strip.

“I want the first discrepancy,” Pencombe said.

Clara breathed once through her nose. “You get to it faster if you ask about kitchen bells at the gate and not the corridor keys.”

Pencombe gave a small, careful smile.

“We do both.”

The third strip had no date, only times written in the hand used for market orders and medication reminders. At 22:41 was a note, then a line with two columns: `k-door — held` and `k-door — held by`.

Pencombe took the pencil and copied it exactly.

“Why ‘k-door’?”

Clara frowned and looked at Vale as if he might know what household people call in shorthand after midnight.

“Kitchen door to service corridor,” Vale said. “The one staff use for supplies.”

“Then who held it?”

“That line is empty.”

Pencombe did not raise her voice. “Your empty line is a story.”

Clara’s shoulders twitched. She looked down at the ink where one line had been scraped.

“Because I did not ask in the right house,” she said, and she crossed herself with a quick motion she had to force back.

“Did she tell you,” Pencombe asked, “that she had not seen who entered through the corridor?”

Clara shook her head once.

“No one enters there after dusk without a note.”

Pencombe felt the first sharpness in the exchange and set down her pen.

“What changed the note? You said here is a late-hour discrepancy.”

Clara took a half step back and tapped the unheaded strip of paper under the pin. It held one line with no time and one with a correction slash.

“I checked every plate after twelve,” she said. “I wrote: key not returned 23:00. Then I crossed it out. If I kept it, it implied somebody should have seen me admit it was wrong.”

Pencombe’s pen moved faster. A line of ink became a line of pressure in the air.

“Crossed out for fear of whom?”

“No one, exactly. For fear of making the house seem less careful than it is.”

Vale watched the room with his hands on his knees and the patience of a man who knew where keys slept and where fear lay.

Pencombe turned the formal ledger to the bottom where Clara had copied private entries under household lines.

The first line from the private strip had one missing timestamp. It sat between 21:12 and 21:33.

There was no number at all, just a stroke and a date: `Maid’s passage — not logged`.

“Did the maid pass then?” Pencombe asked.

“No,” said Clara.

“You wrote it.”

“I wrote the question I was asked to note.”

“Who asked?”

“Not a questioner. A messenger.”

“From where?”

“Door hall.”

Pencombe held the paper against the lamp and could see where the line had been erased by rubbing the side of a thumb instead of a blade.

“The line is missing on purpose,” she said softly.

Clara’s patience had limits, but she did not break.

“If purpose were the question,” she answered, “you have to ask whether I was told to hide a delivery. If it was a delivery, I had to keep the house clock, not my fear, in line.”

She reached for another strip and gave Pencombe a neat note from the key inventory.

“22:56, kitchen key moved to corridor ring. 23:03, key ring logged returned.”

“Who signed 23:03?”

“No signature in this book.”

Pencombe’s first sentence to the line was only, “Good,” and then she stood.

“Where is that key ring now?”

Clara lifted her wrist and pointed at the corridor pegs.

“There used to be one mark there. It is not now.”

Vale stepped forward, not to intervene but to ask.

“You told me at station this morning your key hook showed continuity,” he said. “You did not include this.”

Clara did not blink at him.

“You told me to wait for Inspector Pencombe on this one.”

The sentence moved across the room like a draft.

Pencombe accepted it and nodded. She hated that the sentence had been true.

“We will go to the stair and test every minute,” she said.

Before they left the table, she pointed to the missing entry.

“Read this line.”

Clara hesitated, then read the private strip:

`22:56 — k-door held`.

Then below, in cramped hand:

`23:01 — k-key out (no time)`.

Pencombe wrote both lines into her notebook and said to herself, in the same voice one might use for bad weather:

“House time cannot be empty when a key is out.”

## Scene 2 — Clara’s Timeline

The hallway to the service corridor felt narrower than in daylight. Someone had already taken the time out of its corners, left the walls damp against the stairs where the house listened for noise.

In this scene, Pencombe stood back and let Clara speak first.

“I said I would keep the house intact,” Clara began. “I did what I was paid to do. The house had grief to hold.”

“Hold grief honestly,” Pencombe said.

“I did not hide grief,” Clara replied. “I hid small movement.”

“Because you thought movement did not matter?”

“Because everyone said it did not matter.”

Clara stepped into the first room. She did not look at the key hooks; she looked at the doorway frame where paint had lifted in a thin crescent.

“At ten twenty,” she said, “this frame was dry.”

“And at ten forty?”

“There was moisture on the stair banister where one person passed with one hand on the rail and one key ring in the other. I marked it because the boy should have left the key here, and he did not.”

The boy had a name, and Pencombe could have used it as pressure. She did not.

“You mean the one from station?”

“Yes,” Clara said. “He was not in the book then.”

“Who gave him access?”

“He said it was an estate correction.”

“Estate correction means what?”

“You ask that question in front of the law and the family if you can.”

“Answer it for me.”

Clara pressed her lips together, then gave way.

“A correction that never made it into the official bell note.”

She moved on to the kitchen.

“At twenty-one ten, I had the pantry count and two serving boys in and out. At twenty-one thirty, I wrote all keys in their hooks and checked the inventory tray. All right. At twenty-one forty-five, I could not. The top corridor had a cold draft and no one admitted to opening a door to correct it.”

“Did you keep one light on?”

“One.”

“Which?”

“The passage lamp near the fire-room.”

Pencombe moved toward that corridor and checked the brass mount herself. The glass around it held the faintest finger print in oil.

“There is no one who can pass there without being seen, not unless they wear either an honest uniform or someone else’s trust.”

“You knew he had trust,” said Pencombe quietly.

“Who?”

Clara flinched.

“No one who looked for it in public. People asked at the study door. I listened there and in the pantry. The household staff were asked for names, and each name had a witness, except the one who did not ask for a witness.”

She had reached the second room where the fire-room began and lifted the lamp so the flame touched the upper skirting. A dark line ran there, narrow and hard.

“This line,” she said. “You saw it on your first week, Inspector.”

Pencombe looked down and saw soot against painted wood with a small smear not from coal, but from hurried fingers on a warm stone.

“Fire-room passage.”

“At twenty-two, maybe. I did not set the line and I did not clean it. It was already there.”

“Who would be in the fire-room at that hour?”

“No one by house order.”

“Then why was the passage lamp lit?”

“Because somebody wanted the corridor lit. That is all.”

Pencombe looked into Clara’s eyes and then at the ledgers pinned in her apron pocket.

“Tell me the sequence that made you cross this line today.”

“At nine this morning, the house clock struck and I heard the door at the front hall. Then the key hook at kitchen was one mark short. I told myself one of the boys had taken it to the side room for a cleaner.”

“Then?”

“At nine twenty, I wrote the missing key and I crossed it out because I do not report a theft before I can prove theft.”

“You didn’t prove it.”

“No.”

“You proved time.”

She gave the smallest nod.

“The kitchen ledger’s missing timestamp is not fear,” she added. “It is a refusal to put a lie into ink before I could check it against a clock, a bell, and a gate.”

Pencombe could feel Vale’s breath change from patience to anger. She gave him a line of eye to keep still.

“Your missing timestamp and your crossed key line both point to interruption at 23:00,” she said, and she looked at the corridor instead of Clara. “But I need one name before I can tell who interrupted it.”

“Are there names in your household who have keys in both circles?” Pencombe asked.

“No.”

“One person with private service trust?”

Clara shook her head once.

“Only one,” she said.

“Who is they?”

“Not they, Inspector. `One` who is known by more than one room.”

Pencombe waited. She disliked this tone and knew Clara was balancing loyalty against truth.

“If I say `household member` and it is not one, you may hold me for misleading.”

“Then answer the other way,” Pencombe said.

“There is a route card with one family token and one outside line.”

Vale gave a sound at the back of his throat.

“Outside line?”

“From the service side only. You don’t know how often staff are warned not to use it at night unless rain is running into the cellar, but we had rain and no one called.”

Clara took one more breath and touched the inventory strip.

“You want a name. I can give you a place first: service ring key, and then stair lock three.”

Pencombe said nothing. Then:

“Which place received that key before dawn?”

“Not the kitchen.”

“Then we know one direction already.”

Clara did not celebrate the statement. She looked down and read from the ledger at last:

“Stair lock three by passage to the old conservatory turn. It is not in the formal house ledger because the corridor has no hour marks.”

“Why did you not write that immediately?”

“Because I believed it belonged to someone else’s shift and I wanted to avoid public panic.”

“Now we have enough panic to name it.”

“The name is not on this strip,” Clara said.

Pencombe let the line settle. The house had become the same kind of room as the study—everything ordered, everything concealing. But Clara’s voice now had the edges of someone exhausted from withholding details that do not feel like lies once the day has moved on.

“Who said no panic?”

Clara gave no answer. She closed the ledger and placed both palms on the table.

“I said no panic,” she said at last. “Because if it becomes public before we know why the key left the hook, every witness in the district becomes either suspect or accomplice.”

“And therefore safer for everyone?”

“Yes.”

“No,” said Pencombe. “Safer for someone.”

Clara looked at her, and the room gave no one an easy victory.

Vale moved his hand over a row of hooks near the pantry and found the iron where a key might have hung and one day had hung.

“This is C-011 if there was passage in service corridor after closing,” he said.

“C-011?” Pencombe said sharply.

He gave a look.

“You will name it in your chapter notes later. Write it now, Pencombe: fire-room soot line, private corridor crossing, and missing key return with no timestamp.”

Pencombe nodded without breaking.

Clara exhaled and gave the one admission the chapter required:

“At twenty-two fifty-six, I placed the kitchen key with the corridor ring. I intended to note the return at the proper minute. I forgot it twice, and by ten in the morning I had made one correction. That correction should have been the original line.”

She looked at Pencombe, as if she had just committed a procedural crime and not a homicide-adjacent obstruction.

Pencombe did something small and deliberate: she wrote the full hour in her notebook and drew one square around it.

“Now your correction has a first name.”

Clara’s face did not move.

“A correction has a shape,” she said.

“So does a lie,” Pencombe answered. “Let us tell the two apart.”

## Scene 3 — Bells, Trams, and Station Logs

At station house, the corridor clocks had all taken the same weather in different ways.

The wall clock marked half-hour late by nearly four minutes if believed, and the dispatch clock had lost the same segment to a damp spring. Yet in this city, if two clocks disagree, a watchman still keeps the tram log, and the tram bell still marks its line.

Vale arrived first and spread the station’s dispatch pages on the evidence table, one edge pinned by a brass nut he borrowed from a key box.

“If we do this by the clocks,” he said, “we get no witness and no chain. If we do it by bell and tram, we get sequence.”

Pencombe brought the first strip from Clara and the private domestic ledger she had copied.

“We need to test for a false corridor window,” she said.

He copied the private lines into his notebook:

- 22:56 — kitchen-door held
- 23:01 — k-key out (no time)
- crossing of stair lock at service corridor
- unlogged note at 21:33 maybe

Then she handed him the station page where the tram office had sent the first dispatch message that night.

“The tram at 22:40 did not leave the central shed on time,” he said, “because fog and line brake. It left at 22:44.”

Pencombe folded the paper in three and did not smooth it again.

“At 22:44, then, there is a possible transfer window.”

“No one can cross that much distance from Hallowford service lane to Saint Jude without crossing at least two bells if they choose lawful routes,” Vale said.

“Unless they crossed by private service route,” Pencombe answered.

He turned two pages and found one row in the log with a clipped strip of red wax paper as if someone had removed one note then replaced it.

“Who was in the dispatch office?”

“An operator and a replacement boy,” Vale said. “The replacement noted no emergency traffic because no one wanted the log to show a private corridor line.”

Pencombe glanced at him.

“Not want. Instruct.”

He nodded once.

“There is a correction line under the dispatch delay.”

“Read it.”

“`Misdirected line held at relay point`,” he said. “No signature, no counter-note.”

Pencombe wrote that line under “repetition check.”

The station bell rang from below the staircase, late. The hand at the top of the clock reached 23:03 and then hesitated again.

Vale looked at the paper and said quietly:

“This is the same minute where Clara says key is out without return marker.”

“And now we have one architecture rule,” Pencombe said. “No witness can stand on this minute without a chain.”

“Let's ask the dispatch boy if he wrote this from delay, or from instruction.”

Vale called the boy. He came in with the smell of wet coal and a nervous posture that makes men look older than they are.

“You were on relay at twenty-two fifty to twenty-three,” she asked.

“Yes, miss.”

“Did you mark all lines?”

“By the book, yes.”

“Who asked for relay delay line?”

“I was told to hold one line because of weather and no visible sender.”

“Who is ‘I’?”

He swallowed.

“No signatory line, Inspector. Sir, I only held what was marked as possible confusion from Bell House.”

“Did Bell House send it?”

“No.”

“Then who?”

He stared at the desk edge, then looked toward the stairs.

“A legal clerk. I know the handwriting from station forms.”

Pencombe waited, not repeating the obvious.

“Name.”

He spoke barely above a whisper.

“Lionel. Lionel Bracken’s office hand.”

Vale wrote that down before Pencombe finished the question. They had not placed Lionel in this house corridor scene but the link to legal route control in Saint Jude’s had been seeded in earlier chapters.

“Did he ask for line suppression or transfer delay?”

“Transfer delay first, then suppression.”

“Meaning?”

“He said public timing should not follow private movement. We logged it as weather for the hour.”

The boy turned white under the lamp.

“Could have gone either way,” he added quickly. “I did what I was told.”

Pencombe answered with the same procedural calm that made her dangerous to men trying to lie:

“So do we now, except the line becomes a clue.”

Vale had already moved to compare this with the station bell and tram times.

He spread a chalk line across the table:

- 22:56 kitchen corridor held
- 22:44 tram delay
- 22:56 tram dispatch correction
- 22:57 legal clerk instruction
- 23:03 key out without return

“Every line says one person had enough instructions and enough time to keep one package out of public movement,” he said. “Not to kill, not yet. To keep it from where it should be.”

“And now to get that packet,” Pencombe said, “we need keys.”

“Or a key path,” he answered.

They asked the operator to bring station bell records and the tram clock card for the same window. It took a minute to fetch, because the bell card had been folded into an index behind a notice about dockside deliveries.

The bell card showed that between 22:50 and 23:05 there were three short bell marks and one long correction mark registered from the quarter quarter of Bell House lane.

Clara had said one long correction line.

Pencombe repeated the same phrase, once.

“Long correction,” she said. “No one ringed a full warning at Bell House lane.”

Vale made the practical note.

“Either weather or direction. But we have an instructed delay matching a corridor key interval.”

Pencombe looked out the station window where fog pressed the gaslight into small moons.

“Tell them we are not done with Saint Jude yet,” she said to Vale.

“Not done with Hallowford either,” he said.

She looked at him with one of those half-smiles that are a tactical courtesy.

“Then finish the domestic side tonight, and I’ll finish the station side tomorrow.”

He shook his head with the expression of someone who preferred work to words.

“We should finish both before dawn.”

## Scene 4 — The Repaired Clock

By the time Pencombe asked the house to reopen the service corridor for a replay, the fog had shifted from rain to sleet, and the fire-room light had a hard white halo around it.

She asked for three people and one key ring: Clara, Vale, and Hargreaves from Saint Jude’s had agreed to come with instructions.

They began at the hallway clock in the main stair, the one that ran true when no one leaned on it and when the bellhouse had not had rain in the frame.

Pencombe marked each minute with chalk.

“22:40,” she said. “House corridor normal.”

“22:45,” she said. “Tram delay begins.”

“22:50,” she said. “Kitchen key still on hook.”

Clara watched this with both fear and precision.

“You said no return.”

“You said ‘22:56 held.’”

“Yes.”

She stepped forward and pointed where the key hooks should have held. She held her hand there for a full three counts.

“This is where missing key line starts.”

Pencombe wrote.

“Now we replay,” she said.

Vale took the second key ring and went to stair lock three.

“You need body movement, not memory,” she said. “Who stood where, and why.”

Vale lifted his body against the lock and mimicked a one-handed passage. He had the practical confidence of a man who trusted weight over speculation.

Clara said, quietly:

“If a person passed with one hand and no lamp, the key would have knocked the lower lip of the frame.”

Pencombe moved to the stair lip and looked at the paint where the line would strike.

There it was: two fresh marks, one at shoulder height and one too low, each with the width of a brass edge.

“So someone passed fast,” she said.

“Or someone had a shorter key holder,” Vale added.

“Could be either,” Clara said. “Not one in our books.”

Pencombe’s pencil made a short scratch.

“The house ledger says no one passed with official staff ring from this point to one-minute. If we take this as unauthorised, then what moved through?”

The house clock on the wall near corridor B gave a soft jarring click as if the spring resisted one extra turn.

“Packet,” said Clara, surprising them.

“Say that plainly,” Pencombe said.

“A sealed packet. Not medicine crate. Not parcel. One packet carried in two hands then lost to a side line.”

Vale frowned.

“You mean `M-B 2 c`?”

“Maybe,” she said, “or something like it.”

Pencombe considered this as both a deduction and a test.

“Where?”

“In the old conservatory stair, by the service lamp. It stays lit when people pass who are expected, and it stays lit even if they are expected not to be.”

She moved to the fire-room and traced the soot line again.

“This line,” Pencombe said, touching the black crescent, “is not from the fire-room itself.”

Clara did not argue.

“Where else?”

“Door frame and corridor rail,” Vale said. “Someone passed from kitchen to corridor and paused near the stove to hide a hand movement.”

“How do we test that?”

Pencombe turned to the brass stove and held a folded strip against it.

The paper warmed quickly at the edge and then held a faint sheen. It was a trick to test draft and hand placement, not guilt.

“If a hand passes here while the lamp is held low, the soot drifts differently.” she said.

Vale and Clara leaned in.

“The soot line indicates one pause,” Vale said.

“Not a panic pause,” Pencombe added. “An intentional pause to mask sequence.”

She asked for station bells again.

Vale produced the card from his pocket and held it against the wall.

“If this line is right,” she said, “then our timeline can be reduced to one interval: 22:56 to 23:03.”

No one spoke until the house clock clicked to 22:58 and held.

“From this interval,” Pencombe said, “we have a held service key and no return; a bell correction; a tram delay; and a legal-clerk relay hold.”

“And missing timestamp in your private ledger,” Clara said quietly.

“Exactly,” Pencombe said. “Timing is now active, not decorative.”

“Then who?” said Hargreaves, who had quietly remained by the door.

Pencombe looked at him.

He shook his head.

“Only names,” he said. “I have none yet.”

“Then we make names,” said Vale.

Pencombe gave him the same look he would give if he had asked too soon.

“No. We make chains.”

She drew the line in chalk between lock three and house passage and then toward the corridor bell.

“Clara, read out the one note in your private strip you have not spoken yet.”

Clara did, almost against resistance:

`C. Room — if private ring passes, keep the corridor lamp; no one sees key on its return.`

Pencombe did not blink. She repeated the line, then repeated it again, slower.

“If private ring passes, keep corridor lamp; no one sees key on its return.”

Vale repeated it to himself as if testing weight.

She moved to the last line she had not asked.

“And this?” she said.

Clara read the final notation:

`22:59 — bell correction by external instruction`.

Pencombe and Vale exchanged one glance. That was no domestic note. That was procedure borrowed from station work.

Pencombe folded the paper and set it inside the inner pocket of her coat.

“I think now we can phrase the constraint,” she said. “No one in this house moved a corridor key for illness, duty, or family emergency. Someone moved it by design, then tried to erase a timestamp so it looked like weather.”

Vale put his hand on the fire-room skirting and touched the soot.

“We have one physical pattern,” he said. “One key, one corridor, one window of correction. I can ask questions from this.”

“Not yet,” Pencombe said. “First we ask one last person who can answer where the ring came from.”

Outside, there came three short bell taps from the lane.

She turned.

“Not your home bell,” said Clara. “Those are the station quarter bells.”

Pencombe smiled at the housekeeper’s precision.

“You’re telling me the house clock has kept one thing true all night,” she said. “Not that it keeps time, but that someone needed it to be confused.”

Clara nodded.

“I can keep clocks straight, Inspector. I cannot keep people from lying inside them.”

Pencombe looked at Vale.

“Then we proceed from 22:56 and the missing return. We ask Saint Jude’s records who held the private ring, and how it left this house without touching the household ledger.”

Vale lifted the key ring from the table and held it by one finger as if it had no mass.

“By morning,” he said, “that ring has already had three stories attached to it.”

“Then we tear two away,” said Pencombe, and went toward the door.

As they stepped out, Clara called after her with an abrupt, low urgency.

“Inspector, do not forget the lamp in the passage.”

Pencombe paused only an instant.

“I will not,” she said. “The lamp now has more to say than the bell.”

## Clues & Revelations

- **C-009** — Clara’s household inventory ledger includes a missing timestamp for a service corridor transfer around the forty-seven-minute mark before midnight, showing a known gap in domestic continuity.
- **C-010** — The kitchen corridor key was recorded as moved to a service ring, but no trustworthy return marker was logged at the key hook interval, supporting a missing custody transition.
- **C-011** — A soot line in the fire-room passage indicates brief movement and pause at a late hour inconsistent with household duty patterns.
- **Household timing constraint established** — The chapter demonstrates that key and clock consistency, not motive alone, is now the central investigative constraint; irregularity is structurally deliberate.
- **Communications overlay** — Correlating dispatch delay, bell correction, tram lag, and household key movement creates the earliest stable domestic link to institutional timing suppression.
- **Red herring pressure** — Illness-care timing and generic servant-access explanations are reduced to partial truths once the timeline can be reconstructed to minute-level conflict.

## Continuity Notes

- This chapter advances `DOC-004` Chapter 4 requirements by explicitly staging household timeline reconstruction, domestic corridor replay, station-log cross-checking, and Clara’s partial admission that modifies her earlier statement.
- It introduces `C-009`, `C-010`, and `C-011` while keeping prior clues `C-006`, `C-007`, and `C-008` active as the foundation of the medicine-access architecture.
- Timeline reconciliation now places household movement within the same contradiction window as station and tram signals (`DOC-006` `T-007`) and prepares the chain for later reconstruction of key custody and delay governance.
- Motif use follows Phase A constraints (`DOC-007`): fog, clocks/bells, keys, ledgers, and corridor passage become evidentiary devices rather than decoration.
- Household authority and witness-cost consequences remain consistent with `DOC-001` social architecture and `DOC-002` personality constraints for Clara, Pencombe, Vale, and station actors.
- Open continuity note: the identity tied to the unlogged corridor key transit remains unresolved until follow-up interviews and cross-checking of records-transfer actors.

## Draft Log

- Completed full prose for Chapter 4 (`Clara’s Clock`) in the prescribed section format.
- Integrated `DOC-004` sequence requirements: timeline board reconstruction, service replay, tram/bell/dispatch cross-check, and Clara’s partial correction.
- Added and advanced architectural constraints around key-custody timing (`C-009`, `C-010`, `C-011`) in alignment with fair-play and reconstruction rules from `DOC-005`.
- Enforced motif and rhythm constraints from `DOC-007` to keep timing evidence and social pressure as co-equal drivers of deduction.
