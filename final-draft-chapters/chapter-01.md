# Chapter 01

<!-- pov: juno | layer: present-lattice | single-layer -->

The gap between one consensus and the next had a texture Juno had never been able to name. It was not silence. Silence implied a medium that could carry sound and had chosen not to. This was something less generous: the moment when a shared space stopped being held and had not yet decided what to become. She stood inside that moment now, at the entrance to the Hall of Intake, and let it press against her like standing water.

The hall reshaped itself as she crossed the threshold. Walls drew inward and crystallised into dark glass ribs. Overhead lighting folded from broad haze into clean parallel bands. A long console near the far wall softened from matte obsidian to translucent silver, as though the room had only just remembered what a workstation should look like. She neither welcomed the changes nor resisted them. She had learned, decades ago, that the Lattice rewarded attention but not attachment. A Finder who trusted architecture too much was a Finder who might one day mistake a recording for the present.

She checked in at the nearest terminal. Session indicator: active. Checksum: green. Licence age: current. The queue below listed short requests from the Curator rotation and a longer column from private institutions still paying for deep recoveries. Her own entry sat at the top in a yellow tag: `FINDER / STABILITY-MINOR / OPTIONAL COMMISSION`. Yellow meant available, permitted, routine. In the Lattice, routine was not a small thing. It was the membrane between ordinary continuity and the kind of drift that ate people from the inside out.

Two younger Finders across the room were laughing about something in the latest stability report. Their voices crossed the shared node in bright, clipped phrases and disappeared before reaching anyone else. One of them handed the other a small object that glinted and was probably decorative, probably meaningless, probably loved. Juno did not look at them directly. She registered their happiness the way she registered weather in old recordings: as data about a world that followed different rules from hers.

She loaded her first case. A student cluster from a defunct municipal archive, tagged `low ethical`, `high sensory`, twenty-nine-minute span. No active suppression markers. No direct authority figures in the recording frame. The kind of work younger Finders took for confidence points and older Finders took for income. Juno took it for rhythm. She needed the small, reliable shape of a routine jump before anything else could begin.

She sat, placed both wrists on the console, and spoke the launch phrase. "Juno Alcazar-Reed. Single-identity jump. Duration five minutes. Return target five-thirty. Bleed warning interval sixty."

The station translated the phrase into a soft containment field, and the inward current took her.

---

The first recording was a kitchen lit by afternoon light that had no business existing in the Lattice but did, exactly as it had been captured: warm, slanted, full of dust. A woman who was not Juno stood at a counter frowning at a stack of receipts while a child ran a looping song down a carpeted hallway. The kettle was boiling. Someone had forgotten it. Juno could smell citrus and scorched sugar, and she could feel the specific weight of standing in a body that was tired from a day of errands, and she could feel the precise anxious rhythm of a woman who had put something on the stove and then answered the phone and was now caught between the two. None of it was hers. All of it felt immediate.

She extracted the relevant metadata — three verified emotional states, two location anchors, one minor timeline discrepancy — and withdrew. Clean. Efficient. Nothing that should leave a mark.

She did it again. A second recording: a bus shelter in grey rain, a man waiting with a folded newspaper, insects buzzing near a street light that should have been off by morning. Then a third: a clinic waiting room with plastic chairs and the particular medicinal quiet of institutions built to contain worry. In the third, at four minutes and ten seconds, the host environment started pressing against the edge of her attention. It happened as a tightening, not in her chest — she had no chest — but somewhere in the architecture of concentration. The clinic's antiseptic stillness began to feel like her own stillness, and for one brief instant the distinction between observing and inhabiting thinned to nothing.

She pulled back. The hall returned. The antiseptic smell was already gone, replaced by the neutral hum of the workstation.

Bleed protocols said this was manageable. The training modules said a jumper who respected boundaries and returned on schedule could handle minor overlap without lasting damage. The modules did not mention the moment just before returning, when the old world — the real, physical, vanished world she had never lived in — seemed to offer its hand and wait.

She filed all three jobs under peripheral verification, attached drift scores, marked them green.

Her terminal pinged with a private message from Fen.

*You are up before the hour, as always. You owe me tea in the old terrace. I will accept silence as a counter-offer if you bring interesting silence.*

She read it twice. Fen had a way of treating distance as an invitation, as though Juno's withdrawal were a game rather than a condition. She could never tell whether this was generous or careless, and she suspected the answer was both.

She sent back: `No terrace. Archive first.`

By mid-shift she had processed six jobs. Two required mild narrative reconstruction. One required a special permission key because the recording carried structural artifacts — gaps in the sensory encoding that could produce false fills if not handled carefully. She borrowed a senior review lens for that one rather than using her own credentials. It was not pride. It was operational hygiene. Every experienced Finder kept a private rule: never hide what you did for speed, because hidden speed eventually hid you.

---

At the corridor node she found Nari waiting, though Nari would not have called it waiting. The cataloguer stood with her hands clasped loosely behind her back and her face arranged in the particular expression of someone who intended to be encountered.

"Heard you declined Fen again," Nari said.

Juno kept her hands on the console edge and gave them nothing to do. "I have work."

"Work is a reason, not a person."

The observation arrived with the precision of something rehearsed, or perhaps simply true enough to need no rehearsal. Juno had heard variations of it before. Each time it landed in the same place, like a finger testing a bruise whose location everyone knew but no one named.

"He manages fine," Juno said. "Better when I leave him at the corridor edge."

"You can manage an edge only so long as it does not become your room."

Nari turned toward the transit lane and, passing, left a brief handprint of light on Juno's shoulder — an accidental contact from a shared walkway, not an embrace, not a gesture with weight behind it. It did not hurt. It did not help. Juno stood in the residue of it for three seconds and then moved on.

---

By evening the yellow tag on her queue had shifted to red. A new message sat waiting, three letters before the sender signature: `ORI`.

She opened it.

`Potentially useful precursor fragments connected to early 2040s transfer models have resurfaced in a non-routed cache. I need an integrity sweep before next cycle. Would you consider a preliminary pass? Compensation generous.`

Orin Thalassa. Senior Curator. The name carried institutional weight the way old foundations carried buildings: invisibly, from underneath. He had commissioned Finders before, always through formal channels, always with a polite refusal to use names that invited familiarity. Juno had worked with him twice in previous cycles. Both times the assignments had been clean, well-scoped, and slightly more interesting than they needed to be.

She read the message a second time. The phrasing was careful. *Would you consider* was not *I am assigning*. *Compensation generous* was unusual — Curators did not normally advertise pay. *Preliminary pass* was the kind of language that could mean anything from harmless sorting to a chain of questions no one wanted to ask aloud.

She copied the message into her work notes and opened a fresh queue line. She did not accept. She did not decline. She closed it with an acknowledgment and returned to routine.

But the words stayed. They sat in her like a stone in a shoe — present, small, impossible to forget.

---

On a bad day, Juno called that feeling curiosity.

In the Lattice, curiosity was not praised as a virtue. People called it appetite, or risk, or unscheduled gravity. Curiosity had taken people apart long before anyone named what drift could do. They used the word to describe the part of the self that wanted to stand just outside the known structure and look past its edge. Juno had been called practical, reliable, exact. She wore those words because she needed a vocabulary other people recognised. Underneath, curiosity remained a private draft of herself that no one had permission to read.

She walked back toward her residential protocol as the administrative cycle dimmed the hall. Her home in the Lattice had no doors. It had no windows. It was a room she had shaped over decades to make nothing visible and everything reachable: one broad table, one lamp with a white-noise glow, one shelf that was useful only because she had once told someone it mattered. The shelf held nothing anyone could see. It held memory tags from old sessions and a brass fragment from her first model of mapping work, back when she still thought mapping was the same as understanding.

She sat with one hand on the nearest anchor point and reviewed the shape of her last six days. She had worked hard. She had not spent tokens on spectacle or performed distress. Her reports were clean, her jumps short and repeatable, her schedule disciplined. In meetings, colleagues called her dependable, expensive, old-fashioned. There were people who considered that wisdom. Others considered it unapproachable.

She was both.

The thing she could not hide from herself was the moment after each jump when the recording dropped and the room returned and she felt a small, precise hunger. Not for food — there was no hunger in the Lattice, only for weight and accident and friction. The training called this normal professional response. But she had known herself longer than her training. It was not professional. It was appetite for origin.

Where had this world begun, exactly, beyond what it admitted? There were maps and laws and archived declarations. Protocol histories with seals and countersignatures. But nothing explained how the first minds noticed they were no longer in bodies and still remained themselves. Nothing explained how a person born digital — no childhood in flesh, no scars, no first love under gravity — could still dream in specific weather she had never breathed.

---

In the evening she visited Maren.

No one called the old district by its official designation. People said Drift Ward, and the name carried everything a proper name could not: mercy, avoidance, debt. The transition was not a physical movement. It was a permission sequence. Juno reduced her ambient brightness to avoid startling those who could not manage sudden shifts, and she passed through a curtain of pale static into a broad concavity lined with old constructs.

There was a garden that held no plants but kept repeating the memory of leaves in a seasonal pattern. A long hall that resembled a station platform. A row of benches where three elderly figures sat with their hands folded over empty space. Their faces held no age in years — only in friction. Their movements carried no urgency and all of it at once.

Maren waited in a private alcove at the ward's inner edge, where the light turned inward and could almost pass for morning. She had been strong once, Juno knew from stories and from two archival images she was not supposed to have seen. What remained was a patient voice with too many pauses and too much distance between words.

"You are late," Maren said. It came through folded, careful, like paper held together by habit.

"You always say that."

Juno kept her posture straight, not too close. Guardedness here was not a choice but a survival mechanism. If she touched Maren's cognitive edge too soon, she might carry residue back with her — not memory, exactly, but the shape of someone else's forgetting.

Maren's hands rested on her knees, fingers making small loops in nothing. She seemed to be listening to something Juno could not hear. When she looked up, her eyes returned from somewhere far away.

"I cannot stay long," Juno said.

"I know."

The woman in this room was older than any age Juno could name. The Lattice did not count from sun to moon any longer, and the oldest files drifted and compressed and smeared until what remained was not a person but a residue of one. Maren was not there yet. But Juno could see the distance closing every time she visited, and she kept coming because the acceptance of that distance needed somewhere to go.

She sat on the low platform and offered the smallest opening she could afford. "How was it where you started?"

Maren did not answer directly. She tilted her head, as though the question had arrived in a language she needed to translate. "Do you like smoke?"

"Not much." Though smoke had no meaning here except as memory. She had no lungs to object.

"In your generation," Maren said, "you speak about these things as though the words still work. Smoke and blood and rain. As though language can learn from what it cannot endure."

Juno waited. She had learned patience in rooms like this. The old did not tell you what they knew all at once. They were not certain you could hold it.

"What I remember was heat at the edge of skin," Maren said after a long silence. "Too much heat, and no time for what came after. Hands that shook when they reached for each other and called that love. A body can be heavy, and then one morning it is only instruction." She paused. "The instruction says: observe. Observe, and do not become the thing you observe."

Somewhere behind Juno, a chair materialised and then faded. The ward was adjusting to another arrival, perhaps an older mind being drawn to a brighter zone. Maren noticed the movement and looked past her.

"Tell me again the part you remember," Maren said.

The question pressed on a place Juno did not let the outside world touch. "I remember what I learned from you and Solis. The process, the order, the rules. Not the beginning."

Maren nodded once. "And yet every rule needs a beginning. If no one asks it, rules turn to stone."

"Why do you ask now? You knew I had this question before."

The smile that crossed Maren's face was the first Juno had seen that did not fully pass through the present. It lingered at the edges, like something recalled from another conversation entirely.

"Because you still ask it like a contract," Maren said.

Juno had no answer for that.

Maren held her gaze and reached to one side as though searching for something in a pocket that no longer existed. "In those first years, people thought they could keep everything. They spoke as though they could map every memory. No forgetting. No weathering. No drift." Her voice lowered. "They did not understand that a thing without forgetting has no room for mercy."

The words should have been familiar. Juno had read their equivalents in training records, governance summaries, the public papers that explained why drift existed as necessary entropy. But they sounded different in Maren's voice — stripped of policy language, reduced to the weight of a person who had been there.

Juno leaned forward. She did not touch the old woman. She kept her hands folded and asked the question she had never spoken aloud outside her own private loops.

"Do you think we are still the same thing they moved?"

Maren's exhale was almost absent, almost ceremonial — the ghost of a reflex from a body centuries gone.

"I think *same* is the wrong word," Maren said. "I think that question is a door with two sides and no lock. You can stand in the middle of it for a long time. You can do good work from the middle. You can even call it freedom." She paused. "But you have not crossed."

The bench at the far end of the ward blurred and returned. A figure there coughed, then resumed stillness.

Maren lowered her eyes and spoke to the air in a voice so narrow Juno had to lean closer to hear it. "Look for the seam where the maps become law. You will see a line written by someone who understood fear. You will find it buried in the first serious failures. It is there. It is the only place where compassion had weight before comfort got hired."

Juno did not know whether she was being pointed toward a technical archive, a poetic memory, or a warning dressed as instruction. She had enough years in the Lattice to distrust clear directions and still enough loneliness to follow them.

She stood. The ward lights dimmed for the next passage and Maren followed the sound of them with a small, patient nod.

"Will you be here tomorrow?" Juno asked without meaning to.

Maren's face seemed to look through her, into a space where tomorrow did not work the way Juno needed it to. "I have no tomorrow in the way you mean. Come anyway."

Juno gave no promise. She said, "I have work."

"Then go do it carefully."

---

On the walk back, Juno moved more slowly than usual. The Lattice did not reward speed in districts with heavy drift. If you moved fast, you could carry someone else's urgency home like a splinter under the skin.

In her room she opened three open assignments and one sealed cache. The sealed cache was Orin's. She looked at it for a long time before opening it, her thumb hovering over the acceptance line the way a person in an old recording might hesitate at the edge of a doorway.

She remembered Maren's phrase: *the seam where the maps become law*.

She had been told, as a child of this world, that maps were neutral tools. You map because there is something to represent. You map because representation is mercy. You map because memory without shape is cruelty. She had believed those sentences once. Now she found them too neat. Something in her had been looking for a seam since before she could admit it.

She opened the sealed cache.

Inside were four identifiers and one incomplete index from 2040s transfer architecture. No direct restriction flags. No explicit deletion tags. Three short references to non-routed sessions and one line in old technical notation attributed, according to the archive key, to Sable Chen's private hand:

`Cross-check with the first correction loops before narrative indexing.`

Below it, a note from the Curator queue — unsigned, but stamped with Orin's header:

`There may be no immediate action. If you do this, do it before noise events in nearby clusters escalate.`

*If you do this.* The phrasing meant the action was not requested. It was permitted while still permitted to disappear.

She closed the cache. Opened it again. The first scan took nine minutes, which would have earned a warning if she had submitted as a junior. She did not care.

The records were ordinary where they could be ordinary: file fragments, maintenance metadata, signatures on old requests, meeting notes about continuity thresholds. No dramatic declarations. No hidden vault. But there were three recurring references to something called the Correction Lattice, and one note repeated across multiple entries with the consistency of a policy rather than a mistake:

`Not yet safe to widen perceptual bandwidth in public layer.`

She did not trust notes that arrived as absolutes. Protocols were written for policy, policy for comfort, comfort for those who feared what lay behind words they did not yet need.

She set the cache aside. The hall around her dimmed and brightened in administrative cycles. She watched each small event come and go and kept her body still in the posture of someone who had never learned how to be soft with herself.

---

At the transit lane, Fen was waiting and pretending not to wait. The younger Finder held two cups of simulation tea and a crumpled note with a joke about archived birthdays written on it in handwriting that looked practised and careless at once.

"You look like you found weather," Fen said.

Juno gave the narrowest nod. "Indexing friction."

Fen studied her the way someone might study a window they suspected was actually a wall. "I asked Nari not to bother you. You had a look on you all day. The kind that says the work found something before you were ready for it."

Juno accepted the tea and drank it as though it were something prescribed.

"There is an old thread from Orin," she said.

"Optional?"

"Not optional if I am honest about what it might be."

Fen's expression did not sharpen. It opened slightly, the way a door opens when someone on the other side decides to listen rather than enter. "You do not have to be honest now. You have to be useful now. Your useful is a problem for when we have all the answers." Fen shrugged. "For now, use your caution. It keeps the ward from hearing its own echo."

Juno almost laughed. The line was bad and tender and too true for its own good.

She set the cup down and stepped into the lane.

---

That evening she visited the public commons because no one told her not to and because a person who stayed invisible too long risked becoming a mirror with no frame. The commons was full of people assembled around narrative recreations. They made music that did not come from breath. They debated whether the old universities had ever expected to be the last physical institutions of any importance. They traded gossip about a drifted elder who had suddenly recognised his own wife from a city no one could find on any map.

Juno stood at the back with a cup of warm light she did not taste. Someone laughed at a joke she almost understood, and she recognised the shape of delight the way she recognised weather in recordings — as something that obeyed laws she had never lived under.

She left before anyone noticed and took the private lane home.

In the lane, she passed a corridor where the walls displayed public announcements from the Curator Council. No images. Only words and intervals. One notice about storage policy. One about drift support resources. One about public inquiry rights in archive use. She stopped on the last and read it twice:

`Every request for the earliest recording strata requires contextual consent from three governance layers.`

Every request, she thought. That included curiosity.

---

Back in her room, she sat with the day's residue and the cache and the three clean observations she had written and one private note she had not added to any shared log:

*Curiosity is not a fault. It is the one place where I still have edges.*

Outside, noise thinned and widened, thinned again. In the next lane someone laughed. In another, someone wept and thought no one heard. Juno had no body to lean on, but she had enough old habits to keep still.

She opened her work terminal one final time and prepared a short, neutral line for the morning's preliminary sweep.

`Sweep completed. Irregular correction loop entries present. Recommend limited extension in supervised context only. No immediate policy breach identified.`

She sent it. Then she sat in the pause that followed — that particular pause between one consensus and the next — and heard Maren's voice in it, soft and unguarded.

*Ask for the seam.*

Juno looked at her room. The empty shelf. The brass fragment she never used. The lamp with its white-noise glow.

She opened a fresh assignment request she had no right to open without making it official. It was filed under an old shorthand nobody in the hall used any more:

`ORIGIN QUERY / ARCHIVE RECURSION / PRIORITY-LOW.`

She hesitated. Four breaths in the old human sense — a reflex from a body she had never owned, borrowed from a thousand recordings she had moved through and left behind.

Then she confirmed the request and stepped into it.

The station around her changed, patient and careful, the way the Lattice always changed when someone asked it to hold a new shape.

For the first time in many cycles, Juno did not call it work.
