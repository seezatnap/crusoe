# Chapter 03

<!-- pov: juno | layer: present-lattice (lead) | shifts: present → commission-room → present -->

Juno left the archive graph open and did not close it.

She sat in the middle of her work ring until the architecture around her had thinned into what passed for stillness — no social pressure, no station calls, no queue tags flashing yellow with routine assignments. The phrase that had been circling her for three cycles sat at the centre of her attention like a hairline fracture in glass: visible only when the light caught it, impossible to forget once seen.

`ROSETTA`.

Not as a headline. Not as a rumour. As a thread stitched through six separate log sectors where a careful editor should never encounter a single concept with such consistency.

She had found the pattern before she slept. She had told herself it was coincidence, because coincidence was the only word the Lattice gave to people trying not to be afraid. The phrase had returned at the end of her final jump — the conference room with its damp-wool air and stale coffee — in a sentence too deliberate for its context: *Call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it?* She had copied it. She had written a note beneath it in her own hand. She had told no one.

The station marker refreshed at the top of her queue.

`UNRESOLVED THREAD: RESTRICTED RECOVERY WINDOW / ENTRANCE NODE READY`

In the Lattice, urgency was a social behaviour, not a visual style. A warning was a warning only if someone else reacted to it. No one reacted to this. The marker waited with the patience of administrative protocol, and behind it sat a request from a Curator trust address she had learned to recognise years ago and never learned to trust: the signature line that was all initials and institutional etiquette.

`From: ORI-TH / Curator Office / Recovery Desk`

`Subject: Target cluster inquiry for procedural integrity`

`Juno Alcázar-Reed: you have the one assignment profile that may still be able to follow the requested path with acceptable contamination exposure.`

The first line could have been courtesy. The third was not. It was the kind of sentence that made a person check whether her own face had changed while reading it.

She opened the attachment and found the rest in compact, almost blank language.

`Potentially sensitive. Commissioned recovery for Engram-linked continuity records. Standard terms do not apply. Compensation is above-grade for this unit and includes discretionary trust support. You are requested to proceed. No prior work has been denied. Your response is expected at your earliest attention.`

No date. No file list. No destination cluster.

No mention of risks, no mention of rights, no mention of what was actually being asked.

She closed the message and pressed her knuckles flat against the nearest desk plane until she could feel the ghost of old wood in what was code and light. A trick of her own concentration — she could coax tactile memory out of inert surfaces if she held still long enough, a habit left over from too many jumps through kitchens and clinics and train carriages where everything had grain and weight.

---

By the time she opened the room to its full ambient register, the station's morning lane had already shifted around her. Three other Finders were trading micro-briefs in narrow conversation channels, splitting their attention to parallel tasks the way people split heat in cold weather. Their words arrived as soft flickers.

Fen was one of them, easy to identify by the impatience in their rhythm.

"She is reading that thing again."

Juno did not turn her head fully. She did not need to.

"Yes."

"If it starts with no metadata," Fen said, "it usually ends with a debt note."

The sentence crossed her line and vanished in one clean inhale. Fen never did concern without a joke attached, the way some people never served tea without a biscuit — not because the biscuit mattered, but because the gesture said the tea was not an interrogation.

"I have spent a whole day with warnings and three private fields," Juno said, "then found one clean sentence like that in every difficult job."

"There was nothing clean about this one."

Fen did not press further. That was the courtesy they kept for her because they respected what they called her professional pride and what she called her habit of disappearing behind protocol. They sent one short clip, unsigned.

`Some people call this interesting. Most call it expensive. A lot of people still want it to remain expensive and mysterious together.`

Then a second:

`If you can refuse without consequences, do it. If you can refuse and still work, do it. If you can't refuse, ask for the thing in front of you to be written down.`

Juno did not reply. She could hear Maren's voice in her own bones, the way old warnings sometimes returned not as memory but as the shape memory left when it had done its work and moved on: *Do not stand too close to the first years unless you can bear your own outline changing.*

She had stood too close all week.

She opened a private intake form and began writing before she felt the decision arrive.

`Orin packet. Commission request received. Potentially sensitive. No metadata. No urgency. No direct assignment details. Pending response.`

In the Lattice, writing your own hesitation as a note was both confession and shield. She could have ignored the request. She had been careful enough to avoid every assignment that sounded like a question with no edges.

She did not ignore it.

She scheduled a direct appointment in the Curator corridor and left the interface open as evidence to herself — a small, deliberate honesty, like leaving a door ajar so you could not pretend you had not walked through it.

---

The chamber had been reduced to three useful details: a broad table with no visible edge, a single line of seating, and a wall lit in old-bronze tones where there were no seams. This was the kind of room Curators built when they wanted to ask ordinary questions and make certain no one mistook them for ordinary.

Orin was already there.

He waited with both hands placed on the table, back straight, his attention held in a shape that made his age feel like calibration rather than decline. He had the same stillness she remembered from their previous encounters, the same restraint — but narrower here, closer, the tone of a person who had built this room once and then made himself impossible to surprise inside it.

He turned one fraction of his face when she entered.

"The Aldebaran corridor gave me a delayed ping that you had accepted," Orin said. "That was not a greeting."

"It gave me one too."

There was no unnecessary gesture. He had always spoken as though each word had to justify itself before it came out, and the ones that survived carried the weight of having passed a private audit.

"Thank you for coming without a formal call."

"You sent a formal call without details."

He did not flinch. He reached for a slim archive node and placed it between them the way someone might place bread on a table — not an offering exactly, but a statement that what followed was intended to be shared.

"You are being offered a recovery commission that does not fit routine channels," he said. "Linked to early Engram continuity artifacts that may have been moved into safety buffers years ago. The work is not public. The outcomes are expected to be accurate, fast, and nonpublic." He paused until she had read the node once, then looked up. "You may continue, decline now, or ask your office to reroute it."

She did not answer immediately. She had seen him give this shape of courtesy to three kinds of people: one who had already decided and would use the courtesy as permission to act sooner, one who was offended by the structure and would leave, and one who wanted reason and risk before anything else.

She was the third.

"I know why I am here," Juno said.

"I know what you have asked for."

"I know what you have not asked for."

Orin let that rest on the table.

"There is no direct ethics marker," he said, "no chain annotation, no context. That is unusual, yes. We can clarify if you need it." He sounded faintly impatient with the word *unusual*, as though admitting its existence cost him something he preferred not to spend.

"Clarify it now," Juno said. "If this is payment for speed, say so."

He inclined his head, the movement so slight it could have been a trick of the bronze light.

"It is not speed," Orin said. "It is precision. The work appears simple on the surface and complex in method. We need a person who can stay on structure when the structure does not give shape." A pause. "Your earlier work in private sweeps has shown that skill."

She had no reason to feel flattered. She had no reason to feel safe either.

"What kind of work, exactly?"

"Recovery with provenance reconstruction. If this were a standard request, I would hand you tags and a packet and it would be done by policy. This one is older. The path to it was written before policy took its current shape." He folded his hands. "You would pull nodes around the 2028 to 2030 transition period, where recording continuity was experimental, incomplete, and then made legal through retroactive review. It is not enough to retrieve memory fragments. You are reconstructing why a continuity map changed shape after it appeared complete."

He said *shape* the way some people said *memory* in old books — as though the word meant more than its definition and less than its reputation.

"Historical detective work," Juno said.

"Not quite. Constrained recovery under preservation law. You would not be writing interpretation for the public index, only continuity integrity." He paused and let the phrase settle. "You would be paid for that burden."

The room held one sound: the soft static of the light at the wall, as though the architecture were trying to keep itself from interrupting the next sentence.

Orin reached for a smaller pane and turned it toward her.

The pane held terms.

- Compensation: 4× base Finder retention rate per hour, with immediate disbursal of contingency stipend.
- Recovery support: one discretionary infrastructure waiver (maintenance tier 7) for six cycles.
- Access rights: temporary entry to two dormant maintenance clusters flagged `legacy-safe`.
- Archive privilege: one-off right to reroute one restricted sequence into a sealed preprint container for analysis.
- Emergency recall: automatic pause on sustained occupancy events with direct Curator override.

She read the list once, then again. Four times base retention was absurd for a task she could not yet define. A discretionary infrastructure waiver was not only rare — it was the kind of instrument Curators did not offer without a reason they would not name. The dormant clusters implied trust and leverage in equal measure. The right to reroute a restricted sequence was a direct line to what others only whispered about.

And the emergency recall line was a warning dressed as a benefit.

She felt the same small, cold precision she had felt the first time she watched Maren's drift in the alcove — not dread exactly, but the awareness that something with a long half-life had just entered the room.

"It looks too generous," Juno said, and put the pane down.

"It is generous."

"For a reason."

"All compensation has a reason." Orin's voice carried no apology. "Sometimes the reason is workload. Sometimes risk. Sometimes urgency. Sometimes we pay in kind when legal pathways are narrow. Here, all three apply. Workload and risk are obvious. Urgency is not discussed before containment." He gave her a small, infuriating smile — the first break in his composure, and it told her nothing except that he knew how to use a smile like a locked door. "Payment in kind is always legal and never transparent to anyone not bound to enforcement duty."

She had expected herself to react with anger, retreat, or a laugh. She did none of them. Instead she felt something she had learned to recognise from difficult jumps: the moment when the body you were borrowing settled into its own discomfort and stopped trying to translate it.

"What about hidden restrictions?"

He looked at her without apology.

"Three." He held up one finger, then folded it into the next as he spoke. "First: you do not disclose scope or outputs beyond the recovery container to any non-Curator actor, regardless of relationship. Your colleagues are not to be burdened. Your own archive notes stay sealed unless reviewed." The second finger. "Second: you do not jump direct into sectors marked `RE-INDEX` unless the jump protocol confirms a safe occupancy window in the first minute. That includes all physically associated records and all derivative recordings with active bleed markers." The third. "Third: if a file presents unresolved references to the `Rosetta` marker in primary indexing layers, you stop. Request triage. Flag, seal, defer. No analysis of that marker outside the process chain — not in your own draft language, not in private writing, not in speech."

He made it as simple as arithmetic, and Juno caught the word *private* and held it.

"You do not trust my private notes."

"I trust your private notes for what they are."

"What is that?"

"A place where an experienced mind can go too far on its own." His hands settled back to the table. "That is why we require a public path for your work here. Our task is not to prevent thought. It is to keep thought from becoming an unlocked system change before there is infrastructure for it."

The silence that followed was the kind that tested posture. She could feel the room measuring how long she would hold the uncertainty before answering — not the room's judgement, of course, since rooms in the Lattice had no judgement, but the architecture of her own self-observation, which was its own kind of room.

She had two reasons not to accept this contract and one reason to do so.

The first: if he did not trust the private parts of her thinking, no contract between them would be clean. The second: no detail about where the nodes actually were meant this looked, from the inside, like every suppression she had been trained to recognise and walk away from.

The third was the reason she had come at all. There was no one else with her combination of caution and appetite for this kind of reconstruction. She had chased the `Rosetta` markers because the word carried a pressure she did not understand. If this commission moved through that pressure from another hand, she needed to see where it entered the present.

She was not comfortable with that motive. She was too used to being comfortable with it.

"How long do I have to decide?"

"The answer is now."

"Give me the rest of your sentence."

The corner of his mouth shifted — not a smile this time, but the trace of one he had decided not to complete.

"Decisions are less clean than people think," Orin said. "The assignment is already in the active queue under your name. If you decline, it is reissued. If you accept, it begins with the first pull before this cycle ends. I am asking so you are not told after the fact." He tapped the pane once. "Signing is verbal. We do not move money by signatures now."

She realised he was not asking for trust so much as calibrated compliance. The difference was subtle and important: trust assumed two directions, compliance needed only one.

She took a breath and gave it room to end.

"What happens if I stop?"

"You can stop by protocol. All recoveries in this stream carry stop conditions. You do not lose your standing if you follow the protocol."

He was telling the truth about standing, she could feel that. Standing was the only currency people needed when everything else could be withdrawn.

She did not smile. Not quite. But she felt the bitter edge of something close, because this was the part he was very good at: he used words like gifts and gave only obligations.

"What happens if I go on?"

"We review each node. You can leave if the threshold moves against you. You are not expected to do what you would not do in open work. But for this stream you do hidden work because too many hands at once would make it impossible to tell what broke, and why."

---

She accepted.

She said the word with her voice and her posture and the small forward motion of reaching for the pane at a place with no text. There was no triumph in it. No obedience either.

Orin nodded once and drew up the commitment chain. The final terms filled the pane in a second line:

- Non-disclosure on Rosetta-linked outputs until reviewed.
- No sharing of recovered sequences with Fen or any partner without explicit clearance.
- No preservation of personal metadata beyond two personal notes per session, sealed from shared channels.
- Recovery terminable by Curator if active bleed exceeds threshold or if metadata includes active custodial conflicts.
- Compensation release automatic unless termination is self-triggered in less than two windows.

Two personal notes per session.

The constraint sat among the others like a small, polished stone in a handful of gravel — the one that was meant to look incidental and was not. Two notes per session was exactly the limit that sounded reasonable while it erased the thing she relied on most: private reflection. The right to argue with herself in writing. The right to build a case in the margin of her own thinking.

"There was no mention of that in the earlier list," she said.

"It is not money," Orin replied. "It is care architecture." A pause. "We must assume that someone else could become your memory if you had room for too many private notes."

The word *care* in his mouth did not warm. It arrived the way institutional language always arrived — polished, precise, impossible to argue with because it had been shaped by people who understood that the best way to limit someone was to name the limit after something they valued.

He stood and held out a small token in his left hand. Matte, warm, stamped with two concentric rings and no emblem. She knew what it was before he named it.

A memory token. Not payment, not proof, not authority. A sealed-vault entry key.

"It is not payment," Orin said. "It is the practical thing you cannot request from standard channels. One emergency transfer of private recovery output directly to your station, bypassing shared queue delays. Use it sparingly. If unused, it expires with your assignment. If sold, it is traced."

His fingers did not leave the token when he placed it on the table.

"Compensation plus that," Juno said, "is unusual even by old standards."

"The work is unusual."

She picked it up. It felt like paper and weight and heat layered over one another — a thing that could not be explained in policy terms, only held.

"Is there a fourth restriction?"

He gave the kind of half-smile a person gives when they have not realised they have already given more than they intended. "There is always a fourth one. Only if someone asks for it."

She sat back. "That was not a sentence about this assignment."

"It was a sentence about why this is not a list."

---

She left the commission chamber with the token in her hand and did not look back.

The corridor between commission rooms was always long when she was moving from decision into consequence. It widened and narrowed by small amounts — not enough to alter footing, enough to force pace. She watched her steps in the surface where there was no floor, only the Lattice's careful approximation of one, reflecting nothing because nothing was the honest answer to what lay beneath.

At her intake station, a message had already appeared in her private queue.

`Comms pending: Discrete transfer complete. Allocation: 4× base Finder retention equivalent. Maintenance waiver authorised for six cycles. Recovery channel: legacy-safe cluster access attached.`

The figures were neat and fast. She had received compensation for difficult assignments before, and maintenance waivers for compliance review. It had not happened before that everything arrived in one stroke, before she had accepted with her whole mind.

She checked the attached transfer and found a second block.

`Special provision: Recovery artifact token (single use). No trade, no resale, no shared audit. Use only for commission-bound output. If unused after assignment ends, it dissolves.`

No explanation. No justification. The kind of generosity that functioned as a leash.

---

The first jump window appeared stamped `RE-ENTRY TEST`. A test assignment with no drama.

`Node Series A-28. Cluster: preliminary Engram pilot logs. Target: one-year segment, mixed reconstruction quality. Instruction: reconstruct lineage integrity only, no semantic extrapolation. Output format: chain-level anomaly map only. Occupancy cap: 1m20s. Warning: Rosetta marker unresolved if present.`

She had accepted this alone. No one waited to tell her what to find.

She entered the first node.

The jump delivered the opposite of her best work: no bustling kitchen, no rain, no child's voice, no burnt coffee. A sterile lab from the 2028 corridor — fluorescent white, too much metal in the air, people speaking in clipped acronyms. The weather, if it had a weather, remained in the memory of a body she did not carry.

Her borrowed world steadied beneath a fluorescent strip and a narrow whiteboard crowded with diagrams. Seven people occupied the room — three already old by that era's standards, two carrying the urgent, brittle concentration of people whose future depended on what the screen had not yet shown.

A woman in her forties in a white coat spoke to a younger engineer, then turned to the recorder. "The replay integrity might read green on this pass, and we could argue for continuity, but do not call it continuity yet." A tired laugh from the back of the room. "It is provisional, useful, and survivable if the noise does not rise."

Juno could see her borrowed hands: one carrying a paper cup of over-steeped black coffee, fingers still marked with graphite from drawing connections. The cup had a bitterness ring around the rim. She lowered it without needing to taste.

She was used to sensory immediacy now. What disoriented her was not the senses but the way the room carried intention. Every person in that space held a private version of the same anxiety, like passengers on a train who all know the delay but refuse to speak it aloud.

One man said they could complete the map and still deny it changed personhood. Another replied that personhood was a legal word — they had a technical problem and a social one, not a metaphysical one. The woman who had spoken first corrected without looking up: it did change what the technical answer meant. People heard one sentence at a time in this room. They were writing that answer as fast as they could and hoping it would not become the only thing possible. She turned and made a face as though this were a joke, and Juno recognised the expression from a hundred jumps — the face of someone who needed the joke to survive the sentence.

She took notes the way she always did: not by writing detail for its own sake, but by tracking what held and what did not.

`Primary cluster incomplete. Mapping chain begins with three competing integrity labels. No stable source chain. No legal confidence above level C. No public release language.`

She did not write about her borrowed body sensations. The restrictions on notes were real now, and she had already spent both of her two private entries on the acceptance form and early constraints, leaving none for this session if she read the terms as written.

She ended the jump exactly on time. The return was clean and unsatisfying — less like exiting a room and more like removing a glove she had only just begun to fit.

---

The second and third nodes arrived in quick succession. The first resembled policy language, the second maintenance arithmetic. Neither appeared dangerous. Both carried the same absence: no room for what the data had become, only for what it had been approved to mean.

`Node Series A-29` asked for anomalies only. `Node Series A-30` asked for continuity tags after release.

Both were marked before she had settled in.

When the second scan struck `ROSETTA / hold-key / local-constraint envelope`, she did not stay. She terminated, sealed, flagged, and sent a short review notice without interpretation.

`RETRIEVAL NOTICE: Node A-30 encountered unresolved primary marker. Occupancy terminated at 1m02s. Evidence: marker flag in restricted secondary annotation. Recommend triage, no narrative extrapolation.`

The channel accepted and closed with minimal punctuation.

`Receipt logged. Review pending.`

No drama, no warning flash. If there was a story in that moment, it was private and entirely practical.

She almost wrote to Fen. Almost asked them to meet at the old transit wedge and argue about whether this was greed, curiosity, or fear wearing better shoes. She did not. The clause about private notes waited in her working frame like a mirror she had asked for and now preferred not to face.

She opened a clean, blank private note and wrote a short sentence.

`The generosity is not the danger. The structure around it is.`

Then a second:

`If I am right, Orin is trying to stop a question from becoming a public instrument.`

That was two notes exactly. That was all she was allowed without violating her own terms. She closed the entry and felt the third reason to accept become immediate and unpleasant: after that line she felt relief. Relief that she had accepted a burden that could still be described to herself as work.

---

A new message appeared before she could return the first cluster to full review.

`From: ORI-TH`

`You observed the marker and terminated correctly. That is why this line exists. Continue with Node A-31 only if you remain within occupancy limits. Keep reports structural. Do not over-interpret.`

She did not smile.

She opened the next node anyway, because she had promised herself she would not leave an edge for fear of what it looked like from the outside.

The fourth node had fewer people and more cables. No coffee cups. The room was half-lit and cold — the kind of cold that recording-era labs produced when the heating budget was spent on equipment instead of comfort. A recorder line sat open on a station terminal at knee height.

`Integrity sweep requires one-off restoration of pre-release edits. Do not call this correction. Call it continuity protocol.`

She recognised the sentence as the kind a meeting produced when no one could name fear without sounding theatrical. She did not linger. She traced data pathways and logged mismatches: timestamps, hash drift, manual override signatures, missing chain continuity. The anomalies were small enough to look like clerical fatigue and large enough to look like institutional choice.

She noticed one name in the side annotations.

`S. Chen — constraints review pending.`

Not central. One line in a maintenance note. The note had the old-world economy of an interrupted sentence.

She felt something that had nothing to do with her own safety and everything to do with sequence. If Sable Chen was attached to this earlier than she had expected, the assignment might already be less recovery and more containment history — not finding what had been lost but mapping what had been deliberately moved.

She flagged the line under `cross-reference` and no one else's eye.

---

Back in her room, she closed the jump and sat still enough that the architecture held its edges for her. A final instruction waited in the queue.

`You have completed first phase. If you accept, do not discuss outside review chain.`

She stared at the line until the room shifted from institutional architecture to what she used to call ordinary. It was not ordinary. She had just learned a way of paying for access that felt like being handed a lantern you were not allowed to light.

She opened a clean draft for the next phase.

`Phase A intake complete. Compensation received. Restricted marker encountered. No Rosetta interpretation written outside chain. Personal note limit now binding for next phase.`

The next line she wrote was not in the project note. It was in the corner of her own hand, where she could choose to keep it.

`I accepted because saying no would leave the same work to someone less careful.`

She closed the slate.

The corridor outside her room had no doors. That was true, and not true — everything in the Lattice was both, depending on how hard you looked and how much the looking cost you. She stood at the seam between lanes and let the compensation figure glow in the corner of her interface. It looked like wealth because it was immediate. It felt like weight because it had conditions. It sounded like favour because the term had not been spoken.

At one end of the corridor, a child from a nearby rehearsal room was learning to laugh at impossible timing — that particular sound of a young mind discovering that rhythm could be its own kind of game. At the other end, a Faded elder moved through a shape that used to be a doorway and never paused. The child and the elder occupied the same corridor, and neither noticed the other, and Juno stood between them and felt the distance like a cable pulled taut.

She touched the token and felt the edge where it warmed and cooled at once.

Then she walked into the lane and began writing an intake report for no audience but her own conscience.

`I accept under observation. I accept with limits, and I accept the limits because my work still needs a shape people can verify.`

No dramatic flourish. No declaration, no vow.

The report ended with the smallest thing she could make an administrative sentence about and still keep it true:

`Next: continue recovery and mark every unresolved node. Any node with embedded Rosetta reference is to remain sealed. No private analysis beyond what protocol permits.`

She signed her name in the line where signatures were expected to be procedural only.

For the first time since the morning's work, the station no longer felt like a world asking her to choose between curiosity and caution. It felt like a world that had never offered both at the same time. It felt like the old world had returned in its most practical costume: a contract.

She accepted it.

Not because it was safe.

Because the danger was no longer abstract. Because the danger now had terms.

And terms, at least, could be tested.
