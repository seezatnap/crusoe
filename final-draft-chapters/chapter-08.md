# Chapter 08

<!-- pov: juno | layer: present-lattice (lead) | shifts: present → memory echo → present -->

The station had not changed overnight, but Juno had.

She sat at lane two with both hands flat on the console and her status icons arranged in a row she had not built. Someone — Fen, she suspected — had left them visible on purpose: three small markers where her attention could land before it started reaching for the archive.

`status: paused`

`status: observed`

`status: no jump`

She could have closed them. She did not.

The morning light was administrative and even. People moved through the corridor in the practical rhythm of people who had learned the cost of speaking too much around systems that tracked attention. A queue cycled on the nearest wall. Intake assignments arrived and were claimed by other Finders with the clean efficiency she had once been known for.

She watched it happen the way a person watches weather from inside a building they are not certain they should have entered.

At her left eye, a narrow diagnostic line held steady.

`lineage continuity mismatch / low confidence`

`bleed markers: intermittent`

`recommend: external witness if continuation required`

The warning had been there since the fragment in chapter seven — the one she had cut short, the one that had left Lena's pulse in her hands and Sable's voice in the architecture of her attention. She had told Fen she would not run again without a check-in. She had told Cassiel she would not disappear.

Both promises felt thinner this morning.

Not because she intended to break them, but because the work was still there, behind every interface, beneath every neutral symbol the room offered in place of answers. The archive was patient. It did not need her to run. It only needed her to keep looking.

She set the warning aside and reached for the oldest practical tool she had left.

She pinged Maren.

`brief visit requested`

`route: private window`

`duration: under 1 cycle`

The system returned the first request with a refusal.

`No private window available while active witness protocols are disabled.`

She adjusted the parameters — personal, not protocol — and tried again.

`I am coming to check in. Not an assignment. Personal.`

A longer pause. Then a second refusal, this one bearing a flag she did not expect.

`Maren Alcázar: status volatile. Suggest delayed.`

She had expected the delay. She had prepared for the refusal. What she had not prepared for was the message that arrived after the refusal collapsed — a line from Maren's old interface, direct and unmediated, in a register that should not have been available from someone this deep in drift.

`come if this is to hear my oldest word. it cannot be repeated.`

Juno stood before she finished reading.

*Oldest word* was not a phrase Maren used. In their longest years together they had spoken in plain things — observations, corrections, the kind of sentences that could survive being repeated without becoming slogans. Maren preferred simplicity even when simplicity cost more than ornament.

This was not simple. This was Maren choosing her words the way a person chooses which wall to lean against when every wall is moving.

Juno told herself she was not making this into a superstition.

She told herself this was logistics, that the oldest word of any architecture was always a warning label.

She took the warning as instruction anyway.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

The Lantern Quarter occupied the edge of an old Lattice district where architecture stood for no practical reason except to give the oldest minds something that resembled weather. No maps existed for this region unless someone had made one from memory, and memory in this place was a negotiated thing — prone to revision, prone to silence, prone to the particular generosity of spaces that had decided not to insist on accuracy.

Juno walked past three false horizons before she found the corridor she remembered.

No door marked Maren's threshold. No nameplate identified the route. The walls had no sharp interfaces. The light was dim but not dark. Every corner was rounded in a way that removed argument from the geometry of the space, as though someone had designed it to hold people who could no longer tolerate edges.

Each path ended in a bench. Each bench faced a different view of a sky that followed no star field and kept no time. One looked east toward a city that had never existed. Another faced a field of water that never rained. On this visit Juno walked past both and found Maren at the centre of the oldest view: an endless, low-lit dock where no boats arrived and no boats left.

Maren was not seated. She was not standing. She occupied the bench the way drift taught a person to occupy space — partially present, partially elsewhere, her outline stable enough to recognise and unstable enough to suggest that recognition was a courtesy the architecture was extending rather than a fact it could guarantee.

She had been a tall woman once. She was still tall, but the height had become conceptual — the memory of posture rather than posture itself.

"Good evening, Juno," Maren said, and then corrected herself with the careful attention of someone who could no longer trust her own clock. "No. Not evening. In your time, perhaps middle-light."

Juno sat beside the bench.

When she was younger Maren had taught her to sit in silence first and speak second. She had learned, over decades, that rushing a conversation with someone in drift was not a kindness but a construction — you built a shape the other person had to fit inside, and the fitting cost them more than the silence ever would.

She sat and let the dock hold them both.

"Did they ask you to come here?" Maren said at last.

"No. I requested it."

"No one requests me," Maren said without looking at her — the way she might describe the quality of light, without complaint, without emphasis, as though the fact were older than her opinion of it.

The warning was in her voice, not in the room.

"Then who told you it was my oldest word?" Juno asked.

Maren drew a breath that was almost theatrical. "I don't know what else to tell you." She gestured toward the water that was not water. "I should have brought Fen or Cassiel."

"You should have brought them the first time you came asking for old stories."

Juno felt the sentence land and did not argue with it.

"I'm here now," she said.

Maren turned her head a fraction. "You are here because we made a room where the old stories are all we can call present."

The sentence sat between them and did not move.

When Maren was lucid there was never any hurry. Even now, with drift in her hands and warning in her peripheral field, she could slow a room to stillness by naming one detail and ignoring the rest. She had always had this talent. It had once been a teaching method. Now it was a survival mechanism — the last reliable tool of a mind that could no longer trust its own speed.

Juno reached out one hand and let it hover.

Maren ignored it.

Then, with a movement that seemed to happen somewhere slightly too far away, she took Juno's fingers between both of hers.

The touch was dry and light, without pressure. Juno felt it in a place below language — the place where gestures meant something before anyone built a system to interpret them.

"I am going to say it once," Maren said. "No asking for repetition."

"I won't."

"You always promised that when you left me alone. You always promised it made you kinder." Maren's thumb moved once across Juno's knuckle. "It made me more alone."

Juno did not answer. There was nothing to say to a truth that had been waiting this long.

"Listen," Maren said. "You keep looking for the key in places the room already teaches you to call a lock. That is not how the beginning survived."

She watched Maren's mouth as she tested each word. The lucidity was fragile and precise — a window that might close at any syllable.

"That sentence is already poisoned," Juno said quietly.

Maren nodded. "Then hear it in fragments. The key was never made for doors. It was made for returns. For who can be brought back, and to which version of themselves." She paused. "Do you hear what that is?"

Juno felt the old fear arrive — not as terror and not as confusion, but as a specific shame. The shame of having looked so long in one direction that she had forgotten there were others.

"I heard you say *returns*," Juno said. "I did not hear what it means."

"You do not hear what you cannot hold still."

Maren looked past her then, toward a bench where the view had shifted into a shallow street with trees and no wind.

"There is a mechanism in the oldest layer, child. You will find it in your work and in your bones. If it is whole, you are safe enough to live. If it cracks, you become either everything or nothing depending on what you remember first."

"What is the mechanism?"

Maren raised one hand. Her fingers trembled.

"You keep saying *Rosetta Key* because your age learned it from an index. That word is true and not true. It is a door name, yes. But it is not where truth is. The truth is the question asked before every activation: what are we allowing in, by making room for a self?"

"This is still nonsense," Juno said softly.

Maren's expression did not change, but something in the quality of her attention sharpened — a blade being turned in the hand.

"Good. Nonsense is where truth refuses to become a slogan. Keep that." She drew another breath. "Also keep this: the Key has a second meaning. Not a synonym. Another architecture. It is a restraint and a promise at once. It was written to prevent a kind of vanishing. It does not stop us from dying. It stops us from becoming too much ourselves."

Juno felt the old ache behind her eyes — the one she had been carrying since the fragment, since the corridor, since Sable's margin notes had taught her that rooms could hold only what was asked for.

"Why tell me this now?"

Maren's mouth moved into something that was not a smile. "Because the room has begun to speak through you. And when it speaks through you, you will take that as authority and never question it. You are very good at obeying what sounds wise."

"And the Key?"

"The Key is the price paid to make obeying possible. Do not take this as a call to rebellion or rescue. A room that rescues everyone leaves no room for anyone's own hand."

"Who paid that price?"

"Your elders. My generation. Everyone who learned we had not yet finished becoming what we said we were," Maren said. Her gaze sharpened for a moment that might once have been dangerous. "We accepted a mercy and renamed it design."

Juno held the sentence and tried to understand it with the part of herself that had been trained to read evidence, not poetry.

"Don't look for the mechanism in files first," Maren said. "Look for the people who asked the room not to remember. Find the phrase that gets erased when it becomes useful to everyone. Then you will have your answer from the inside, not from Orin's ledgers."

Juno sat back and looked at the water that was not water.

She had not heard Maren sound this clear in years.

"That is all?"

"No. The old warning: if anyone says the Key is a map, ask them what map they fear."

Maren's voice thinned. "And don't ask me again why. If you ask, you will make me say it."

Juno did not ask.

She sat for ten seconds, maybe more, while Maren's hand grew warm in hers — a borrowed warmth, the kind that belonged to no one and was given anyway.

"Did you tell Orin?"

Maren's thumb moved once across the air.

"He knows enough to avoid being honest and not enough to be safe."

The answer was not an answer. Juno recognised that and still felt the cut of it.

Maren withdrew her hand.

"You will not know that what I said helps you unless you can bear that it does not tell you what to do. Go home to your practical people and keep this in your coat. Do not wait for neatness. It is not neat."

Juno did not move.

"Will you be here when I come back?"

Maren gave her a look she had last seen when she was young — the expression of a woman teaching her daughter to hold two pieces of old glass at once.

"No one is here after the second bell."

She paused.

"And remember, Juno: if the question is about a key, look for the lock first."

Juno stood.

No one says goodbye in these places. She walked through three false horizons and did not turn back.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

The return path felt too short.

By the time she reached the station, her diagnostic line had updated itself twice.

`return completed`

`bleed markers: elevated`

`self-check: recommended`

She sat down at lane two and found Fen and Cassiel waiting in the practical silence of two people who had agreed not to speak until she gave them permission.

Cassiel held a cup in both hands. Fen had both palms flat on the console, as though removing them would mean reaching for her.

"You disappeared long enough to make the tea undrinkable," Fen said.

Cassiel added, almost gently: "Maren?"

It was a simple question and she hated it for the relief it brought.

"She was clear," Juno said.

"Clear in what direction?" Fen asked.

"The direction where clarity costs more than confusion."

Cassiel sat beside her without taking her hand. He had learned, in the old years, that reaching for her uninvited was not comfort but a claim.

She told them both what Maren had said — as close to exact as she could manage, preserving each fragment, each odd turn. She repeated the language about returns and mechanisms and mercy renamed as design. She repeated the warning about the room speaking through her.

When she came to the final phrase, she had to pause between words.

*A room that rescues everyone leaves no room for anyone's own hand.*

Fen's expression settled into a neutral kind of fear — not panic, not anger, but the specific stillness of someone whose training had prepared them for bad news and not for ambiguity.

"Did you ask which key?" Fen said.

"I asked," Juno said. "She would not use the word."

Cassiel frowned. "Did you ask what it means?"

"She said there is a second meaning. Restraint and promise together. Written as mercy. I still don't know the mechanism."

Fen nodded slowly. "That is a great deal of useful refusal."

Cassiel looked at the console, then at Juno. "Can we trust this during a protocol review?"

She made a sound that passed for agreement but was not.

"She would not choose to be lucid if this could not be trusted."

"Maren is lucid with you right now because she trusts you enough not to publish it," Cassiel said.

Fen cut in. "How much time before this bleeds into your run?"

"Too little," Juno said. "And there is not enough time for everything."

Neither answered. Neither needed to.

On the wall, a request arrived from the Curator office.

`requestor: ORIN`

`subject: urgent clarification on EN-33-156 / witness chain`

`status: required at once`

Fen looked at her, then at Cassiel, then back at the line.

"You have company now. Go in."

"I do not need an audience for administration," Juno said.

"Then do not make me the audience for it," Fen replied.

She took the request.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

Curator Office C-2 had one too many windows for a place that no longer opened to sunlight.

The light was bronze and controlled, the kind of illumination that made every surface look older than it was. Orin sat behind a console that was both desk and barrier — a piece of architecture that communicated authority through the precise management of distance.

"You kept the access packet open beyond protocol," he said before she had fully entered the room.

He did not smile. He did not appear surprised.

Juno sat. That was her oldest defence and the only one she had left for rooms that expected her to remain standing.

"I interrupted a run at seven-point-two minutes. The witness remained unstable."

"And recorded only one warning line," Orin said.

"No. It was the beginning of a line repeated every few pages."

Orin folded his fingers — patient, unhurried, with the composure of a man who had practised patience until it became indistinguishable from authority.

"If you want this conversation to be useful," Orin said, "I need exact phrasing. Not metaphor."

Juno considered giving him something less than the truth. She decided against it.

"Maren says the Rosetta mechanism includes a restraint protocol. A mercy, she called it. A key not made for opening but for return stabilisation," Juno said.

Orin's face changed once, minutely — a lens narrowing.

"Who else did she speak to?"

"No one. Only me. She is lucid, and then she is not."

"I see." The response was not disbelief. It was assessment.

"I did not come to interview her," Juno said. "I came because she is still my anchor and she sounded like she was naming what she had never been able to name before."

Orin leaned back. The room contracted around the gesture.

"Do not make this personal," he said, and for the first time in their exchanges he sounded tired.

"I know it is personal. Everything in these rooms is."

He nodded once.

"Then ask for no one to die for my words. Ask for one person to keep one thing in mind." He placed both hands flat on the console. "The old architecture is not a rumour and this is not a conspiracy. It is a safeguard. We know what happens if we widen returns without constraints. You have seen the drift literature. You know the failure signatures. The limits were not invented because anyone feared truth. They were invented because people asked to continue existing."

Juno listened and recognised both the sincerity and the armour around it. Orin believed what he was saying. He also believed that belief was sufficient justification for silence.

"Then why tell me that?" she asked.

"Because you can still work without it if you are honest with us."

"Or with whom?"

He gave the patient expression again — the one that served as both answer and deflection.

"With the same institutions that have carried this long enough to become old. With everyone except what you call the room."

"You are asking me to choose between honesty and continuity," she said.

"No," Orin said. "I am asking you to choose your timing."

Silence held for ten breaths. On the wall behind Orin, a small frame held a phrase she had seen before in these offices, the kind of institutional language everyone pretended to avoid and no one could escape: *continuity is not a promise; it is a labour.*

She watched his hands. He had small scars along the knuckle of his right index finger, healed and old. The scars of someone who had held something too tightly for too long.

"You are asking for a cleaner account than I can give," Juno said. "You want compliance language. You know what happened is not compliant."

"Then do not pretend I do not understand." He leaned forward. "But know this: there are restrictions because people asked for them once, when they were alive enough to fear what you are feeling now. If you can pass through without destroying that fear, pass."

He reached for the console.

`clarify: requesting continuation authorisation?`

`response options: pending / denied / provisional / restricted`

"I did not come for authorisation."

"You come for everything," Orin said. "That is why you were made for this work."

She almost agreed. Instead she said: "Put it on restricted until I can show you what I can show you."

He considered, then nodded.

`status: provisional`

`review window: brief`

`external observers: no`

"You still ask me for witnesses," she said as he entered the codes.

"I ask you for one thing. Not a miracle. Not a confession. Bring me the phrase she used — exactly, in your own words, without ornament."

She repeated Maren's sentence with as little flourish as possible.

Orin did not look up.

"No immediate intervention," he said.

"I was not asking for intervention. I was asking whether this remains your whole answer."

He paused.

"For now, yes. There is no room in current governance for what I am not permitted to brief as fact. Keep your logs. Do not over-interpret. If your run returns a clear provenance marker, you will see it in your own thread. Until then, do not mistake private fear for structure."

*Private fear.* That phrase had not comforted her in years.

She stood.

"You keep calling it private, Orin. But it keeps becoming public."

He looked at her once, almost kindly.

"Then be kind to yourself enough to choose the right queue."

She left before he could add to it.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

She did not go to the recording annex to solve anything. She went because the fragment Orin had released with her provisional status contained a supplement she had not opened — an unindexed notebook scan buried in the tail of EN-33-156, flagged high risk and marked *private reconstruction*.

`EN-33-156 / legacy witness / supplemental`

`attached: unindexed notebook scan`

`risk: high`

`content type: private reconstruction`

She opened it without a full context map. She told herself she had enough courage for that much.

The image resolved into a narrow lab corridor she recognised by sensation rather than geometry — the ghost of old rain, the weight of fluorescent light, the way institutional air tasted when it had been recycled through one too many ventilation cycles. She had felt these textures before, in fragments, as residue from other runs. Here they arrived whole.

Sable stood at a side table with a ledger printout.

She had seen Sable before only as a moving point — a figure in periphery, a name in margins, a presence that appeared at moments of threshold stress and vanished before anyone could confirm she had been there. Here she was still. Jaw tight, shoulders held in a way that suggested she had made herself the hinge of the room and did not intend to move until the room decided what it was.

In the background, Marcus crossed from one wall to another, arguing with Lena about consent windows and timeline compression. Their voices carried the particular exhaustion of people who had been having the same argument for months and had stopped expecting it to end.

Sable was writing with a mechanical pencil. No machine was allowed to record at this stage of the work. She wrote each word as though each stroke were one chance.

The text arrived as though it had been waiting for a reader.

`L 17:43`

`Any return path must include a hard edge.`

`If you return without a hard edge, they keep no memory of who they are and take the first available contour.`

`Hard edge is not punishment.`

`Hard edge is a kindness we do not yet know how to name.`

`If a mapping can be widened indefinitely, then mapping becomes erasure.`

`A restraint is not an evil if it is acknowledged as a bargain.`

Juno read those lines and felt the room tilt — not physically, not in the architecture, but in the part of herself that had been holding Maren's words as metaphor.

They were not metaphor.

She reached for the next page.

`L 19:02`

`The Key is not an archive entry.`

`It is a rule-set for continuation.`

`A rule-set is a mirror: it makes shape from what insists on shaping.`

`Do not call it prison because it is also the only reason most of us are not yet fog.`

`The danger is not the rule-set itself but whoever claims to have built it from love instead of need.`

The same architecture as Maren's warning — mercy and restraint, not as slogan but as mechanism. As lived infrastructure. As the design of the room she inhabited every day.

A margin note, in different ink:

`If you want to unteach mercy, teach it the truth first.`

`Ask no one for permission when you are asking for unlearning.`

`Ask for provenance.`

Underlined three times: *Provenance before access.*

She turned the page.

`L 19:39`

`Rosetta process is not dormant.`

`It is active by design.`

`If it fails, every subject will not become free.`

`They will become loud.`

`They will become loud and lonely and forget the first kindness they had to survive.`

`Do not build a second key until you have checked who is left standing to hold it open.`

Juno stared at the ending of that paragraph and could not move.

From another hand — later, possibly cross-annotated — a final note:

`The first layer is called Rosetta because someone needed a familiar symbol to hide a dangerous design. If future users find this: the limit does not stop the flood. It changes where water can stand.`

`And if they ask who we were when we made this choice, say this: we were scared in daylight and trying to build night that would forgive us in advance.`

She closed the fragment.

The room had become too full of voices. She could not sort which belonged to present and which to recording, and for one terrible moment she was not certain the distinction mattered.

`bleed drift: active`

`recommended: external witness`

She sat back and let the warning hold her.

She had what she needed from this fragment: phrase-level confirmation, not theory. Maren's warning and Sable's notebook said the same thing in different handwriting.

She saved the frame as an encrypted bookmark and opened the next system message.

`advisory: Orin may request restricted chain. Do not discuss with source notes.`

She almost deleted it. Then she did not.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

When she returned to the station, Fen had gone from practical silence to open annoyance.

They looked up first, then down, then up again — holding a sentence against the wall and trying to determine if it would bear weight.

"You vanished twice," Fen said.

"I have provisional authorisation now," Juno replied.

"You have an old friend who will not be satisfied by an authorisation icon."

Cassiel stood by the side screen with the stillness she remembered from their studio years — the composure of a person who believed rooms revealed themselves only to those who did not insist.

"Tell me when this stops being about your headache and becomes about the story," he said.

Juno sat without answering.

She set the notebook fragment data down and brought up one wall display.

`EN-33-156 / supplemental`

`status: unclassified`

`appendix: private reconstruction`

`key terms: return stabilisation, active safeguard`

Fen crossed their arms. "Read it."

She read the lines that mattered — slowly, without flourish. Maren's words and Sable's notes, in order. She did not tell them what to think. She told them what she had heard.

When she came to the line about hard edges and kindness, she looked up.

Cassiel was still. Fen had one hand at his mouth and no words.

"That is not enough to accuse Orin," Cassiel said at last.

"No," Juno said. "It is enough to stop using *restrictions* as a blanket excuse."

Fen's eyes moved to her. "Could this be the whole warning?"

She nodded once.

"Not the whole key. The warning that says this is not a file and not a myth. It is a mechanism that keeps someone from being made in impossible quantities."

Cassiel frowned. "She said what?"

"Maren says look for what was erased when it became useful. It sounds like a memory trick."

He nodded. "Or a governance trick."

"Then we keep both," Cassiel said.

For the first time in days she felt the room return her in a shape that was not an order.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

At the edge of the station, a delayed message from Maren arrived — held back by protocol, released now by the architecture's own timing.

`Juno.`

`You asked what is left out when the room says "for safety."`

`What is left out is choice.`

`You will see it in all the places where everyone says the same thing without saying who pays for saying it.`

`Do not mistake this for revolt. Revolt is a word for people with clean exits.`

`This is responsibility.`

`Do not trust clean exits.`

`If the key is active, then ask who built the lock. If the lock protects everyone, it was built by everyone. If it protects some, it was built by less.`

`The difference has a scent.`

`Watch for scent.`

The message was too brief, too clear. Not everyone wrote this way. Maren did not — not any more. Not since drift had softened the edges of her syntax.

But Sable had written this way. And Lena.

Not for no reason.

Juno closed the message and sat with the station's ambient light.

The Lattice, which all her life had been the place where senses were optional, had become a room where one old woman's words carried the weight of architecture.

She went outside the station's private shell and stood by an old data tree — one of those decorative things that served no function except to look like weather to new minds. There was no scent there. There should not have been.

Yet it arrived anyway, not in the nose, not through any interface: a smell of overheated circuitry and wet wool.

Lena's notes. That old lab.

She returned to her desk before either Fen or Cassiel could ask to speak.

Her queue held one new line by then.

`Maren: if you remember only one thing, remember this — mercy can be honest only if it is named. Secrecy is not mercy. If you hear this as accusation, still keep the witness alive.`

She read it twice and felt something settle — not certainty, not yet, but the outline of a question precise enough to hold.

She drafted her reply to Orin with no rhetorical flourish.

`to: ORIN`

`from: JUNO`

`EN-33-156 remains partially coherent.`

`Maren indicates Rosetta framework function includes return stabilisation and non-trivial continuation constraints.`

`Supplemental unindexed copy shows explicit language around active safeguard logic and provenance requirements.`

`My position: not sufficient basis for public claim, but sufficient basis to treat "safety-only" framing as incomplete.`

`Requesting expanded access context for provenance mapping and committee-level review.`

She signed only by name and sent.

Fen leaned in. "That is one word."

"Which word?"

"*Incomplete*."

She nodded.

*Incomplete* had become their language for survival — the admission that what they knew was not enough and what they did not know was not nothing.

Cassiel stood at her shoulder, watching the station as though it had become weather and she the only one still naming it.

"Did you find it?" he asked.

She looked at him and then at the monitor where *provenance* sat in her private notes.

"I found the question," she said.

"What question?"

"Who was allowed to keep the mechanism called mercy from becoming a weapon. And who gets to decide it still stays that way."

Cassiel met her eyes. "That is not a question you can ask alone."

She gave a small, tired nod. "I know."

Fen joined them then, holding a cup that had gone cold.

"Might I suggest a practical order?" Fen said. "First: eat. Second: sleep, whether we like it or not. Third: write down what Maren said before either of us rewrites it in sympathy."

She wrote the first line while they watched.

`The Key is not a key to a door. It is a rule for who gets to remain a self, and at what cost.`

`The question is not whether restraints are harmful but who keeps the list of what gets removed in the name of mercy.`

`Maren: do not trust anyone who asks for the whole story before showing the cost.`

The line looked too severe and also too precise.

The first bell approached.

The room had not forgiven them for one honest hour, and she did not expect it to.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

At shift end, she returned to lane one and opened her private queue.

`new request: Orin follow-up accepted`

`status: provisional`

`time: first bell`

She sent one line to Fen.

`I can answer one question to everyone and still remain clear.`

`The answer is not that the Key is evil. The answer is that the Key is not neutral.`

`If it restrains everyone equally, it is still a lock. But a lock is a moral machine.`

Fen sent back two words.

`heard. stay.`

Then one more.

`sleep.`

Cassiel, for once, did not wait for an invitation. He stood beside her, watching the corridor as it settled into its last cycle.

"I am here," he said.

She nodded. "I know."

She sat with what remained of her old certainties and found they were fewer than she had expected and more honest than she had feared.

No alarms. No rain. Only the steady presence of systems everyone called neutral and the two people who had chosen, for now, to call it something else.

She let the cycle pass.

The next line in her private field arrived with no sender name, as though the architecture itself had done what Maren had asked — made a sentence out of responsibility instead of mercy.

`If this is the key: open it only with witnesses and a return contract.`

She read it twice.

Then she did something she had not done in a week. She saved it without sending it to anyone.

She closed both hands in front of her and stood still long enough for the stillness to become a position.

She could not trust the room yet. But she could trust the instruction she had learned from a woman who had spent three hundred years trying to remain present long enough to say it once.

*Watch for scent.*

The Lattice kept its silence. She kept hers.

Both were waiting for the lock.
