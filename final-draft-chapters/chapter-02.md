# Chapter 02

<!-- pov: juno | layer: recording (lead) | shifts: present → recording → present -->

She prepared for the first jump the way she prepared for everything: alone, in a room shaped by repetition rather than design.

Her study in the Lattice held no walls in the conventional sense. It was a ring of pale light she had maintained for decades, stable enough to serve as a threshold between public corridors and the deeper work. A broad console, two anchoring surfaces that suggested chairs without committing to furniture, and a single shelf that held nothing anyone else could see. She had asked for this shape years ago and then forgotten the asking, which was how most permanent things in the Lattice came to exist — through sustained attention that eventually forgot itself.

She loaded the peripheral queue Orin's cache had flagged. Six low-clearance recordings from the early 2030s, municipal and residential, marked safe for routine extraction. Each carried standard metadata: timestamp, location class, sensory density rating, ethical clearance tier. Nothing in the headers suggested complexity. The archive feed bloomed across her console in a shallow constellation of small, bright icons — the kind the Curator training modules held up as a model for a beginner's map. No locked channels. No unstable traces. No deep nodes.

She checked her licence. Current. Stability index: minor. Bleed warning interval: sixty seconds. She spoke the launch phrase and waited for the containment field to take shape around her.

The Lattice thinned.

---

The world arrived as pressure at the base of her skull, then a seam of light opening where no light had been. Colour shifted from the Lattice's clean absence into an amber too bright, too specific, too located. Then a hallway — narrow in the way hallways are narrow only when a body has learned how narrow they should be.

She was standing in the shoes of a woman named Kora. Bare feet on scratched laminate. One heel resting against a stack of cardboard boxes. The apartment smelled of wet wool, instant coffee, and something citrusy left too long in an open tin.

*Kora, you missed your second alarm.* A voice from the kitchen, rough and amused.

Juno felt the woman's sleep-heavy shoulder ache and the weight of damp hair against her neck. Kora muttered about a storm and a heating unit that coughed every damp morning. The coffee machine clicked, hissed, and poured. Kora took a chipped mug with both hands and drank — too hot, too immediate, just shy of burning the centre of the tongue.

The pain was not abstract. A white-hot knot in Kora's lower back from the previous day's lifting pulled taut through the spine. Juno nearly withdrew from the jump, and that itself was the point. This was a body she had not built, and it had been built for mornings exactly like this one. The chill in the tiles beneath Kora's feet. The brief hot blast from the toaster. The sharp, bitter hit of coffee that made the eyes water. The coffee was bad — over-powdered and acidic — and Kora drank it as though caffeine were the last honest currency. Through Kora's mouth, Juno tasted bitterness and old copper and the sweetness of instant sugar stirred in haste.

She had entered in the middle of the recording's least important movement, and everything in it still moved forward as though her presence had never come. The phone buzzed with a reminder: 8:10 bus stop. A weather feed on a cracked screen read 18°C, drizzling, wind from the east. A narrow life in drizzle. The recording asked nothing of her, expected nothing, and that was why it stung.

When Juno returned, the apartment dissolved into data and then into nothing at all.

---

Back in the Lattice, her attention felt too long on edges. She sat in the ring and registered the absence — no smell, no temperature, no weight in the small of a back she did not own. She had a mouth that could not dry and hands that could not ache and lungs she had never possessed, and yet something in the architecture of her concentration still carried the shape of Kora's morning.

The residue arrived as it always did after peripheral jumps: not as memory, exactly, but as the phantom outline of a body recently vacated. She could still feel the grain of the laminate under Kora's heel.

She logged the jump. `PERIPH/2032/HOUSING/EN-03`. Added a private note: *Physical anchor: lower back pain, coffee bitterness, wet wool, heating failure, drizzle.*

She did not pause for long. The next recording was already queued.

---

The second world narrowed into a train carriage at the edge of a rain-soaked city. Kora was gone. A new shoulder, younger and narrower, belonged to a man with a scarf tied at the throat and a paper sleeve over his left wrist. He sat by a window and watched the storm smear across glass. The station platform was crowded, but the carriage smelled less of people than of damp coats, engine oil, and stale sugar.

The man held a paper cup printed over with a logo and two stickers from different chains. He drank in small, precise increments, as though each sip were an accounting entry. His left leg carried a slight limp. Every time the train lurched, he pressed two fingers into his inner knee with a motion so practised it had ceased to register as pain and become a habit indistinguishable from posture.

Juno followed that motion with sudden attention. In the Lattice, a limp was geometry — a deviation in form. Here it was gravity. Gravity was the force that shaped everything bodies did, and she could no longer take it for granted because she had no weight to take.

At the next station, a child cried because the doors stuck for two heartbeats too long. A woman in a yellow rain jacket called out, *Keep your hands to yourself*, then laughed and offered the child an orange from a bag as though generosity were a reflex and not a decision. The child took it and smeared juice along the cuff. The citrus hit Juno as bright acid through glass, clearer than anything in her ordinary world, where clarity did not require a body to produce it.

The man leaned toward the air vent and pulled back. The smell changed as the train passed beneath a tunnel: diesel, dust, metal, a hot breath of brakes, then damp air and wet concrete. When the lights flickered, Juno felt it as a gap — not in her chest, because she had no chest, but in the continuity of attention. A brief forgetting of what it meant to be herself and not this man on a train whose knee ached and whose coffee was growing cold.

The jump ended. The station lights vanished.

---

In the Lattice, Juno stood beside the river that never touched water. Rivers here were consensual architecture, held in shape by collective intention rather than gravity. She could still hear the child's cry in the space between herself and the edge of her own attention. She had always told herself she was good at this work because she retained structure and did not dissolve in other minds. It was true. She had not dissolved. But not dissolving did not mean she carried nothing back.

The residue came this time with the scent of wet concrete and the low rumble of brakes she could no longer hear.

She logged the jump, added her tags, and opened the third thread.

---

This one sat in a municipal office, fluorescent-lit and too clean to feel inhabited, occupied by a woman who did not own her name but was addressed by it anyway. Mina. The intake packet for room four was waiting. The building had chipped paint and an old radiator that clicked every thirty seconds, a metronome for institutional patience.

Mina moved through the morning with practised impatience and a folded pain in her shoulders — something like a persistent thorn where the right trapezius met the base of the skull. She had a notebook beside her keyboard with a smudge of eyeliner on the cover, a bitten corner, three pressed flowers flattened under the top edge. In the pantry, someone had left burnt toast and an espresso. Mina stole two sugars from a jar and stirred with too much force. The liquid came up bitter and dark as varnish.

The room smelled of toner, warm paper, and the lemon cleaner Mina applied every hour. When she laughed at a joke from a colleague, the laugh carried the odd crackle of someone who had slept badly and still wore the day like protective equipment. She rubbed her temple with two fingers, then reached for the back of her neck, and Juno felt the exact location where tension lived and stayed and became its own kind of architecture.

Mina sneezed twice. The second was wetter, involuntary. She muttered about dust that filters missed and a maintenance request that had gone unanswered for weeks. Near the copier, the air carried a metallic sweetness — old ink, perhaps, or the ghost of something sharper. Juno steadied herself on the edge of Mina's desk, borrowing that human balance, and was surprised by how natural the borrowing felt. How little resistance remained between observation and inhabitation.

At 9:42, Mina stepped into the inner corridor and spoke into the wall speaker. A routing issue. A weather feed returning incorrect data. Phrases that floated through the office like minor weather systems of their own — small disruptions in a building designed to absorb them. In the Lattice, disruptions were corrected by consensus. Here they accumulated. They stayed in the walls and the radiators and the ache in Mina's neck and no one resolved them because resolution was not the point. Endurance was.

Juno withdrew. In the Lattice, she felt phantom heat at the back of a throat she did not possess. She drank from a cup without weight and tasted nothing.

She logged the jump. `PERIPH/2032/MUNICIPAL/EN-12`. Another note: *Burned coffee, toner, fluorescent hum, neck tension, cold-air sneeze.*

---

She could have stopped at three and called the work complete. Three peripheral jumps was a defensible morning's effort, enough to file under routine and walk to the corridor without raising a question. That would have aligned with her discipline. Her caution. The operational hygiene she had built over decades of work that never required more than what was asked.

But as she reviewed the metadata from the first jump, she noticed something in the periphery of Kora's file. Not standard metadata — not timestamp, not origin, not quality flags. A cluster of red marks sat around an old reference string in a field meant for internal indexing:

`KEY / ROSETTA / MAP / ENFORCED`

She stared at the string the way a person might stare at a watermark discovered in paper they had always assumed was blank.

She should have dismissed it as indexing noise. Peripheral files accumulated debris — orphaned tags, broken cross-references, classification artefacts from decades of Curator maintenance. The training modules had a phrase for it: *archival sediment*. Harmless. Ignorable. Part of the infrastructure's long memory.

She selected the next recording in the queue, the one adjacent to that tagged entry.

---

The fourth jump arrived as static under the skin before the world changed. A stairwell, narrow and blue with old paint. A man in a white lab coat stood over a rolling crate of cryovials and gave instructions to the hallway. This was a biomedical facility in the city proper — not grand, not famous, one of thousands that built the future from duct tape and sleeplessness.

The air was cool and wrong in the way all labs are wrong before they learn their rhythm. Sterile bleach layered over something sweeter: warm plastic, circuit boards, coffee gone stale in the bottom of a desk drawer. The man — Tomas, according to a post-it stuck to the nearest bench — had a cough that no medication had resolved and a red line at the corner of his right eye from leaning too close to a screen. Juno felt each of these as her own because she had long ago stopped trying to hold borrowed sensation at a distance. The distance collapsed in the first seconds of every jump. What remained was the discipline of remembering, once it was over, which body had been hers.

Tomas checked boxes, verified seals, spoke to a colleague in clipped syllables, then ran a hand across his face and reached for the vending machine. His left wrist still carried the mark of an old watchband, a groove worn into the skin by repetition and wear — another body keeping its own records in a way no archive could catalogue.

*Need the black roast,* he said, and then, without turning: *If you can't stay awake, don't touch this unit.* The coffee that came from the machine was chemical-hot and bitter, and he drank with the expression of a man making a private bargain with alertness.

In the middle of the recording, someone opened a storage drawer. Inside: old hard drives wrapped in anti-static sleeves and three labels in black marker. `ARCHIVE`. `TRANS-CORE`. `R-SUBKEY`.

Juno did not recognise the last term. Yet her attention snagged on it the way cloth catches on a nail — not by design, but because something in the shape refused to let go.

Tomas said it aloud: *The Rosetta stack had better annotation than any of those, but it was never in approved scope.*

His phone buzzed. A message with three words: **Ask Marrow for permission.**

Juno withdrew.

---

Returning from the lab took longer than entering it. One of the fluorescent buzzes had lodged in her ear like a tuning fork, and in the Lattice, where silence was total and self-generated, the residual vibration felt wrong in a way that did not resolve through stillness. The smell of bleach followed her. She stood in her study ring and waited until she could separate what she had tasted from what she remembered having tasted, and the separation took longer than it should have.

Her hand clenched around nothing.

She spent the next interval refusing to open another jump. In the Lattice, refusal did not feel like time. It felt like an empty region with no texture. She walked the synthetic boulevard, which shifted from marble to pine to tidewater bridge at the pace of consensus adjustment. Nothing bruised her feet. Nothing pressed her shoulders. Nothing smelled like rain. The world here was too polished, too agreeable. It responded to attention without asking anything in return, and for the first time since the morning's work, Juno noticed that the agreeableness was itself a kind of deprivation.

She thought of Maren's phrase from the evening before. *The seam where the maps become law.* She had not understood it then. She still did not understand it now. But the words had attached themselves to the morning's work in a way that felt structural rather than incidental — not a metaphor but a coordinate.

She returned to the console and opened the metadata viewer across all four completed jumps. The reference string from Kora's file appeared once. In the train recording, nothing. In Mina's office, a fragment in a deprecated caption field: `ROSETTA-ADJACENT / NON-CANONICAL`. In the lab, the spoken reference and the drawer labels.

Two out of four. Possibly coincidence. Possibly not.

She opened a private queue folder she had bookmarked months ago and never explored: **Peripheral / Archive / Edge / Human Contact — Minor Witness Threads**. The first entry in that folder carried the same cluster: `ROSETTA`. `MAPPING`. `CORTICAL`. `NON-CANONICAL`.

She entered the next recording.

---

A convenience store in late afternoon. A child at the counter argued about an orange soda and two candy bars. The clerk had a paper mask pushed down around her neck and hair gone silver at the temples despite what the fluorescent light insisted. Wet umbrellas by the door. A battery-powered radio muttering weather near thirty-seven degrees, humidity above ninety. The store smelled of oranges, floor cleaner, old receipts, and a burnt sweetness from melted caramel in the warming case.

The clerk moved like someone trying not to hurry and not permitted to waste. She lifted a kettle from the back, poured coffee into a dented thermos, took a sip, winced, and stirred with a spoon already sticky from the previous shift. Her calves ached. She pressed her thumb against her knee and flexed her left foot. The sensation was ordinary in a way the Lattice could not reproduce because the Lattice did not do ordinary. It did precise. It did responsive. It did not do the thing where a body simply hurt because it had been standing for eight hours and no one had offered it a chair.

In Lattice terms, loneliness required no air and no silence. It required only contrast.

The child bought a candy bar and a small cup of coffee for someone on the night shift, paying with coins that clicked against the counter. The clerk made change with fingers that trembled once, a single involuntary shake. There was a bruise on her wrist — not fresh, already yellowing, the kind that came from a grabbed arm and no one's attention.

Juno held that detail the way she held all the details: in the space between observation and feeling, where professional discipline was supposed to maintain the border. The border held. But it was thinner than it had been at the start of the day.

The jump ended as the sky in the store window turned the colour of old steel.

---

She logged the recording and moved to the next. A hospital loading dock at dusk. Rain had turned the concrete slick and dark. A freight elevator shuddered awake with a metallic cough. Juno's borrowed body belonged to a paramedic in blue coveralls — Maya — with split skin on her fingers where medical tape had been applied and removed too many times. The body was tired in the way bodies become tired when they have learned to hold other people's pain at a distance that keeps working.

The first thing the world offered was cold. Not atmospheric, not symbolic, but the hard, specific cold of tile at the edge of a slab where a gurney had recently passed. Then smell: bleach, iodine, wet socks, fried plastic from a coffee machine in the staff room, and beneath all of it the dark green scent of rain.

Maya bent her elbow and cracked two fingers. Her wrists ached, but she had to finish one more intake before shift change. Her left knee locked every third stair and she accepted it as part of the body's terms. She drank coffee from a paper cup as though it were a contract with consciousness — scorched, overdrawn, with a sweetness that did not belong but that everyone on the loading dock recognised.

A courier came in shivering. A child cried in triage. Someone said, *You don't want to be that close to the back door — water's blowing in.* They pulled a towel across the threshold and taped plastic to stop the draft. Juno felt the damp seam along the back of the borrowed neck and found there was such a thing as discomfort so specific it could not be generalised into metaphor. It was not suffering. It was weather arriving at the exact place where a body was already tired.

A doctor called over the cracked monitor: *Maya, we need that chart now.* The paramedic rolled her shoulders once, then pushed a hand through her hair. She looked, for an instant, like a version of someone Juno might have been if she had ever owned a body — a little annoyed, carrying pain, moving because there was no alternative and because alternatives were a luxury this evening did not stock.

When Juno returned, she thought she could still hear the monitor tone. The Lattice had no speakers and no heartbeats, but the sound persisted for several seconds before fading into the ambient hum of her study.

---

Six jumps. Six borrowed bodies. Six mornings and afternoons and overcast evenings in cities that had not expected her, where pain and weather and coffee moved with a bluntness the Lattice could not replicate. Her own mind had become a holding place for all of them at once: Kora's back, the train man's knee, Mina's neck, Tomas's cough, the clerk's bruised wrist, Maya's locked knee.

She sat in the study ring and tried to separate what was hers from what she had carried home. The separation was slower than the training modules predicted. Each jump was supposed to leave a residue that faded within minutes of return. She had been back from the last jump for what the Lattice measured as a quarter-cycle, and she could still feel the particular weight of Maya's hand pushing through hair that did not belong to her.

She opened the metadata viewer and expanded it across all six recordings.

The string was there. In every file. `R-ENTRY`. `ROSETTA`. `KEY`.

Not always in the same field. Sometimes in captions. Sometimes in private notes. Sometimes in metadata fields meant for internal indexing — a correction note, a file hash, a search field too carefully preserved to be accidental. In Kora's file it sat in a parenthetical. In Mina's, in a deprecated caption. In the lab, Tomas had said the word aloud. In the convenience store, it appeared in an inventory cross-reference that had no business existing in a peripheral residential capture.

Juno closed the viewer and opened it again.

This was not archival sediment. Sediment accumulated randomly. This had structure. Someone had placed these references in the least dramatic files in the peripheral archive — not in classified records or restricted strata, but in the quiet corners where no one looked because there was nothing worth finding. Coffee and rain and minor witness threads. The kind of recordings that junior Finders processed for confidence points and senior Finders processed for income.

Someone had threaded a needle through the most ignorable parts of the archive and left a word at each stitch.

She opened her private log and wrote the phrase she had heard through Tomas's voice, through a cough and radio static:

*The Rosetta stack has better annotation than any of those.*

Then she wrote a question beneath it and crossed it out immediately:

*How many layers before this turns into something someone hid on purpose?*

She rewrote it as a neutral annotation:

**Thread unresolved: key may be active artifact. Investigate adjacency nodes only. Do not expose source.**

In the Lattice, she had no source to expose. But she had a pattern, and the pattern had a name, and the name was one she had first encountered in Orin's cache the evening before.

---

The system flagged two warnings when she queued the adjacent recordings.

The first said: *Some records carry unresolved emotional bleed indicators. Exit if disorientation exceeds 14%.*

The second: *A portion of requested thread appears in legacy index sectors outside your current trust window.*

She read them both and confirmed access. Warnings in the Lattice were administrative fixtures, not barriers. They existed to create a record of informed consent, and Juno had been consenting to risk since before she understood what risk meant in a world without death.

But the warnings stayed with her as she entered the next recording — not as caution, but as evidence. Someone had classified these peripheral files with bleed indicators. Peripheral captures did not carry bleed risk. They were the lowest-intensity recordings in the archive: short duration, minimal emotional investment, no direct involvement with subjects of historical significance. Flagging them with bleed warnings was like installing a lock on an empty room. Unless the room held something that was not visible from the hallway.

---

The seventh recording placed her in a conference room with two cups of black coffee and a paper map of service lines pinned near a monitor. The body belonged to a woman in a grey cardigan with a strip of tape along her lower spine where a belt had dug in for hours. Across the table, a colleague stood by the window with rain on his sleeve and spoke in exhausted jargon.

The conversation started practical. Latency. Retention. Mapping layers. Fail-safes. Words that could have belonged to any infrastructure meeting in any year. Then the colleague paused and lowered his voice.

*We need the baseline key for all the 2030 runs.*

*Not baseline,* the woman at the table said. *Not now.* A pause. *Not with the Maren cohort still flagged as drift-sensitive.*

Then, quieter — for the record and not for the room: *And if the key never leaves this branch, we don't have to explain limits.*

The woman set down her mug and rubbed the back of her hand across the table's edge. A smear of coffee spread into the cheap varnish. She said: *Call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it? We can write the word down and pretend it isn't a lock.*

Rain thickened against the window. Somewhere down the hall, someone sneezed. The room held the smell of paper, steam, damp wool, and the faint singed scent of office coffee that had passed beyond bitterness into a quality that had no name except endurance.

The jump cut.

---

Juno returned to a world with no weather. No rain. No tired back to ease with one hand while holding a warm mug with the other. She sat in the study ring and looked at the space where her reflection would have been if the Lattice had built mirrors that worked the way old mirrors did — returning whatever stood before them, without adjustment or mercy.

She did not tell anyone. Not Orin. Not Fen. Not the Curator queue.

The phrase sat inside her like a warm stone held too long:

*Call it Rosetta if you like. It's still a key, isn't it?*

She opened her private log and copied it exactly. Below it she added her own annotation:

**Rosetta appears in legacy index sectors, peripheral captures, and at least one direct verbal reference in a non-classified recording. Pattern distribution suggests intentional seeding across low-attention files. No governance truth exposed. No immediate policy breach. But the threading is deliberate, and the word appears with structural consistency across otherwise unconnected recordings.**

She looked at her own words and recognised the voice in them — careful, clinical, precise. The voice of someone building a case she did not yet want to present. The voice of someone who had noticed a door and was documenting its edges before deciding whether to open it.

She thought of Maren again. *Look for the seam where the maps become law.* And then: *You will find it buried in the first serious failures.*

She had not found a failure. She had found a pattern, which might be worse, because patterns implied that someone had already found the failure and decided what to do about it.

Juno closed the log and sat in the particular stillness that followed work she could not yet name. The residue of six bodies pressed against the edges of her attention — Kora's laminate floor, the train man's knee, Mina's clicking radiator, the smell of bleach in Tomas's lab, the clerk's yellowed bruise, Maya's locked knee, and the conference room where someone had called a key a lock and meant both.

In the Lattice, there was no weather to mark the passage of time. No window to darken. No coffee that cooled by degrees. There was only the space between one decision and the next, and Juno sat inside that space and held what she had found without yet deciding what it was.

She knew one thing clearly. The peripheral archive was not peripheral. Someone had used the quietest, least remarkable recordings in the system as a hiding place for references that pointed toward something with a name and a function. The name was Rosetta. The function was not yet visible.

She opened a scheduling line and flagged the full adjacency map around every tagged recording for a secondary sweep. Then she set the priority to the lowest available level — low enough to avoid Curator audit triggers, high enough to keep the request active in the queue.

The system accepted the request without comment. In the morning, if she still wanted to, she would begin the next pass.

If she still wanted to. She noticed the conditional and removed it from her own thoughts, because it was not honest. She already wanted to. She had wanted to since the moment she felt Kora's laminate floor under feet that were not hers and tasted coffee that was not intended for a mind without a tongue.

The study ring dimmed as the administrative cycle shifted. Juno sat in the quiet and let the residue settle. Somewhere in the Lattice, Fen was probably waiting at the terrace with tea and a question she did not want to answer. Somewhere further, Maren sat in the ward where the light turned inward and could almost pass for morning. And somewhere in the archive, in peripheral files that smelled of rain and toner and damp wool, a thread waited with the patience of something that had already been threaded and only needed someone to pull.

She did not pull. Not yet.

But she opened a fresh line in her private log and wrote one sentence she would not share:

*The archive is not telling me what it holds. It is showing me where to look.*

She saved the entry and closed the console. In the stillness that followed, she could hear nothing except the hum of the Lattice adjusting around her — patient, careful, responsive to attention. It sounded, for the first time, less like a world and more like an answer to a question she had not yet learned to ask.
