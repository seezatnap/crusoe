# Chapter 06

<!-- pov: juno | layer: recording (lead) | shifts: present → recording → present → recording → present -->

The intake lane had begun speaking before Juno arrived.

She noticed the change from the corridor — a shift in the queue's ambient register, subtle enough that a younger Finder would have attributed it to administrative drift. But Juno had spent decades reading the Lattice's silences the way a person in the old recordings might read weather through a kitchen window, and this silence carried purpose. Something in the queue had been waiting for her.

She stepped into the lane and found three markers where there should have been one.

`EN-33-120`

`SABLE / ancillary witness`

`Origin chain incomplete`

`Use discretion.`

The second marker had loaded immediately after the first, with no processing gap — the kind of zero-latency delivery that happened only when an entry had been pre-staged by someone with authority over the queue's sequencing.

`Your last caution has reached the floor.`

`Caution is no substitute for source.`

She read both lines twice. Something in her training answered before she did: verify, categorize, delay, obey. Each step dissolved as she began it, the way a familiar routine dissolves when the hand reaching for it discovers the shelf has been moved. The training was still there. The shape it had been built to contain was not.

She pulled up the cross-reference index for the EN-33 series and ran the query she had been avoiding since the previous cycle. Sable Chen's name appeared in eleven per cent of source passages across the cluster — not as a primary subject, not as a tagged witness, but as a notation. Background. Peripheral. The word the archive used when something was too present to ignore and too distributed to pin.

In the Lattice, pattern recognition was not intuition. It was architecture reading itself through whoever was willing to hold still long enough to notice. Juno had been holding still for three cycles. The pattern had not changed. She had.

She felt cold across the bridge of her nose, as though rain had just dried there.

She turned the sensation into a note before anyone could claim she had invented it.

`No real weather has occurred in the corridor.`

`Weather-like residue remains in sensory memory.`

`Possible bleed.`

The phrase had been clinical when she used it for others. Applied to herself, it arrived with the weight of a door closing in a room she had thought was open.

She set the run parameters. Return route: direct. Occupancy advisory acknowledged.

The transfer came in one long, quiet pulse, and the present fell away.

## Recording: Engram Lab Annex, Autumn 2033

<!-- pov: lena -->

The annex corridor smelled of metal and scorched coffee.

Lena stood there because she always arrived before the systems did — before the overhead strips reached full brightness, before the ventilation shook off its overnight idle, before anyone else had walked the linoleum that carried the particular scuff patterns of a team that spent too many hours in shoes not built for standing. She held a notebook in one hand and a mug she had filled from a kettle nobody else had thought to boil. The coffee was bad in the specific way lab coffee was always bad: over-extracted, slightly burnt, with a mineral edge from pipes that had never been properly flushed. She drank it as though bitterness were a calibration tool.

Marcus had left a checklist on the bench. Sable had not yet arrived.

The run log from the previous evening held one entry that looked wrong — not in its data, but in its language.

`volunteer return delay: within tolerance`

`language continuity: acceptable`

`witness stress: unremarked`

Lena circled the last line twice with a pen whose cap she had lost weeks ago. *Unremarked* was a useful word in rooms where the conscience belonged to no one in particular. It meant the stress had been observed, measured, and given permission to exist without requiring a response.

At eight the volunteers began arriving. A woman from transit services, a retired nurse, a graduate student whose certainty had the fragile precision of someone who had not yet been wrong about anything that mattered. They moved through the intake process with the rehearsed cooperation of people who had been told their participation was voluntary and who understood, in the way bodies understand before minds do, that voluntary did not mean the same thing as free.

By nine the morning's primary subject sat in the recording chair: a school accountant in her forties with a splinted wrist and an overfull phone she kept checking as though the reminders on it were the last evidence that her ordinary life still existed. She asked for tea. Lena said they had none. The woman said tea was not what she had asked for — she had asked for a cup with a chipped rim, because the chip made it feel like a kitchen and not a procedure.

Lena found the nearest chipped mug and gave it to her, and the room recorded the request as though it were protocol.

Marcus laughed once at the absurdity. Then he stopped, because the woman's hands had begun to shake in the particular way hands shake when they are trying to hold ordinary objects in a room that has stopped being ordinary.

Sable entered without knocking. She carried two folders under one arm and the posture of someone who had not slept in the right order for weeks — not disordered, but resequenced, as though her body had been solving problems while the rest of her waited for morning.

Lena said good morning because she wanted the room to stay in the shape of a place where people greeted each other.

Sable answered by sliding one folder open and setting a printout beside the protocol board.

`If the run is to be extended, the witness line must be duplicated.`

`If witness integrity is duplicated, it ceases to be singular.`

`If the subject cannot name where return should happen, return still happens.`

Marcus read the printout over Sable's shoulder. His expression carried the particular annoyance of a man who had been given evidence he could not use without admitting a problem he preferred not to name. "Again with the notes?"

Sable did not answer him. She touched the correction monitor and lowered a threshold by two increments. The display registered the change in amber.

`Correction floor lowered.`

The room tightened — not physically, but in the way a room tightens when every person in it has just been told something by a machine that none of them are ready to discuss. Lena watched the display settle and felt the old question return, the one she had stopped asking in meetings because meetings were not built to survive it: how much of what they called protocol was structure, and how much was the sound a room made when it was trying not to hear itself?

The run began.

The accountant spoke little at first. Then she mentioned a staircase she walked at home. Then a phrase in a language the lab had never supplied. Then the name of her daughter, spoken with the confidence of someone practising a lie she believed was a memory.

At three minutes the waveform held flat.

At four it trembled.

At five it repeated one sentence in two tones — the same words arriving from two directions, as though the recording had found a second copy of the woman's voice and could not decide which was current.

*You're late, and you said we'd call after shift.*

No one in the subject's own life had said that sentence. It belonged to someone else's recording, someone else's evening, and it had arrived in this woman's mouth with the casual authority of borrowed furniture.

The room gave one amber spike.

`Boundary uncertainty.`

Marcus moved toward the interrupt key with the confidence that had carried him through every meeting where someone else had wanted to be forgiven. "Cut at five-fifty-eight."

Sable said, "No. Hold."

The silence that followed was not the absence of speech. It was the presence of a decision that had been made before anyone had agreed to it. Sable's hand rested on the correction panel. Marcus's hand rested near the interrupt. Between them, the subject sat in a chair that was measuring her continuity in increments smaller than language.

Lena did not move. The subject was looking at her and then somewhere above her, as though she had caught a reflection she could not locate.

`Run continues.`

`Return threshold now unstable.`

At six minutes, the accountant laughed in a voice that had two endings. Then she cried once, without tears, and the crying was worse than the laugh because it had no echo — it arrived and stopped as though it had been cut from a longer sound that no longer existed.

Lena asked if she was in pain.

The woman shook her head. "Not pain. Just a sentence that won't fit the room."

She said: *You said you'd take me home.* Then nothing.

Sable reached forward and cut at seven-point-two seconds after the line. The room softened. The subject blinked and returned the way a person on a train returns when the train has slowed before the station — present, but carrying the momentum of somewhere else.

When the run ended, Lena turned off the board and let the room settle. Marcus typed three lines of a debrief that would pass a review committee.

`continuity extension successful`

`witness stress within manageable bounds`

`subject returned with no persistent markers`

Lena added one line by hand beneath his.

`No one asked if we meant what we call home.`

Sable was already at the board with another printout.

`The room says no markers.`

`I am saying no return.`

`The subject has learned two truths and one phrase we did not ask for.`

`Watch what remains after the phrase.`

Lena did not need a manual for that. She had been watching what remained after phrases for longer than this room had existed as a room. But the sentence stayed with her — *watch what remains* — because it described the one thing no protocol had been built to measure: the residue of something a person could not put down because they had never been told they were carrying it.

<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno returned from the annex run with a sensation that had no honest name.

Her station waited in its clean geometry — console, queue, the soft administrative hum of a system that had never known a draft or a delay it could not absorb. The corridor outside her lane held no weather. It held no evidence of anything she had just witnessed. The Lattice was a world without kitchens and without the particular texture of a mug held by a woman whose hands had shaken while she asked for a chip in the rim.

She stood still and tried to separate herself from the recording.

The separation did not come.

She felt cold across the bridge of her nose. She felt a phantom dryness in her throat. When she tried to recall the smell from the run, the air offered two scents at once — burnt metal and warm rain. Neither should have existed in the Lattice, and both arrived with equal certainty, as though the architecture had accepted them as legitimate without checking their source.

She opened her bleed monitor and read the assessment.

`Bleed indicators: mild +2`

`Primary symptom: involuntary sensory import.`

`Secondary symptom: fixation loop on unverified source name.`

`Recommendation: reduce unstructured jumps.`

She stared at the recommendation until it blurred. The system was telling her what Fen would tell her, what Orin's restrictions had been designed to enforce, what every training module she had completed in her first century of Finder work had stated in language careful enough to survive any objection: sustained focus on a single source creates vulnerability, and vulnerability in the Lattice was not a feeling. It was a structural condition.

She knew this. She also knew that knowing it had not changed the fact that Sable Chen now occupied eleven per cent of her peripheral awareness without having appeared in a single primary recording.

She opened the lane map for the EN-33 cluster and expanded the cross-reference view. The percentages had shifted since her last check.

`Sable appears before naming in 11.2% of source segments.`

`Sable appears after naming in 7.9%, typically within 14 seconds of witness stress.`

`Potential pattern: observer insertion.`

`Potential risk: identity anchoring to non-primary figure.`

The phrase *identity anchoring* described exactly what she was trying not to do. It described a Finder who had stopped observing a recording and started building a private map around a figure the archive had filed as background. The training modules called this fixation drift. The commission protocol called it a risk marker. What it actually was, Juno thought, was the slow recognition that someone in the peripheral field had been placed there by a hand careful enough to make placement look like coincidence.

She rubbed the place where her shoulder should have been — an old gesture from old concentration exercises, borrowed from a body she had never owned. The station around her offered no resistance, no texture, nothing to press against. She was alone in a room that gave everything back without keeping anything for itself.

She checked her channel for Fen.

No response yet.

She could have closed the queue. She could have called the cycle done.

She did neither.

She opened a second target in the same cluster.

`Open: EN-33-041`

The transfer came with the old metallic smell and a whiteboard crowded with circles.

## Recording: Engram Conference Room, Winter 2034

<!-- pov: lena -->

The conference room had one window nobody opened and one screen showing a map that pretended to be a view of outside. The fluorescent lights had the specific frequency of institutional lighting that made every skin tone look provisional.

Lena sat through three budget updates and one grant call while the rest of the room debated threshold tolerances as though they were personal virtues. The language had shifted since the annex run — the same words carried different weight now. *Acceptable* had become a shield. *Manageable* had become a prayer. *Continuity* had become the one thing everyone wanted and no one would define, because defining it would require admitting what they had already done in its name.

Marcus wanted to present the latest extension results as a breakthrough. He was right in the narrow way numbers are right, and wrong in the broad way people are wrong about what can be saved if only the curve stays flat.

Dara arrived late, carrying a notebook she had not opened and a coat she had not removed. She looked like someone who had run three meetings and decided the last one was with people who would remember everything and forgive nothing.

Sable stood near the back with a folder she did not open. She had the quality of an equation waiting to be read — complete, present, available to anyone who knew how to look. Nobody in the room looked at her directly. They addressed the whiteboard. They addressed the screen. They addressed Marcus's graphs with the serious attention of people who had learned that attention to numbers was the safest form of courage.

Twelve minutes into the session, Orin appeared. He was younger in this recording — his face held less accumulated patience, less of the architectural stillness Juno would come to know from commission rooms. But the restraint was already there, already careful, already built to outlast whatever it observed.

He asked why the witness notes in the private margin had increased while the published debrief remained unchanged.

"Because the thing we can measure is not the thing we are using," Lena answered before anyone else could fill the space with something useful.

Orin did not respond to her. He kept his attention on the screen and asked about protocol compliance.

Marcus answered with the confidence of someone defending a bridge by calling it a road. Compliance, from a distance, looked like certainty. At close range, it was mostly the maintenance of fear.

Sable finally spoke. "I see that if a room can hold more continuity, it can hold less of who it serves."

Marcus called it poetry. Sable called it a warning. There was no one to applaud, and neither of them needed applause. They needed the room to record what had been said, and the room — the institutional room, the room of minutes and protocol and chain-of-custody — had never been built to record what mattered. It had been built to record what survived.

A woman from administration said that if continuity and retention improved, they could justify the next expansion window.

Lena felt angry at the chart and hid it in the gesture of folding her arms. The expansion window was a polite name for a gate wider than any single ethics review could cross. Everyone in the room understood this. Everyone had agreed, by the accumulated weight of twelve months of meetings, not to say so.

Then, as though timing had learned how to play favourites, a volunteer call came from the annex lab. The woman from that morning — the accountant with the chipped mug — had gone home and reported the smell of rain at the wrong hour. Not in her apartment. Not in the city. In a room she could describe but had never visited, in a building she could not name but whose linoleum she could feel under her feet when she closed her eyes.

The call should have alarmed everyone in the room. It alarmed no one because alarm would have required someone to name what the call meant, and naming it would have required stopping the work.

Lena took the message and asked for three minutes alone.

She found Sable where the wall met the exit, standing with the quality of a person who had not asked to be seen and would not accept being overlooked.

"How much of this is the room and how much is us?" Lena asked.

Sable's answer carried no comfort. "It has already begun deciding for both. We are late because we keep calling it after the fact."

"Can we stop saying *no home*?" Lena asked, and the question was too soft for the building and exactly the right volume for the room.

Sable shook her head. "No. We can stop saying we are the ones deciding what home means."

She turned back toward the table. Lena followed as though one room had become the margin of another.

The meeting continued. Protocol language for witness return. Better warning tags. Revised disclaimers. The room produced a new sentence for the bottom of the debrief form:

`Witness continuity may preserve narrative but not consent equivalence.`

Marcus read it as though it were an insult. Orin read it as a practical delay. Lena wrote one last line in the margin of her notebook and showed it to no one.

`Language can be a fence if we stop pretending it is a home.`

Sable saw it. She gave the smallest nod — the kind of recognition that happens between people who have learned to communicate below the room's official frequency.

Late that evening, after everyone had left, Lena remained. She sat in the emptied conference room and looked at the cleaned logs on the screen. The attendance list had been typed. Beneath it, in someone else's handwriting — small, precise, unsigned:

`Sable: observer`

Lena stared at the word. She reached for it and stopped. She did not know why she left it. Later she would understand that leaving it was the first act of curation she had performed in Sable's name — the decision to let a label remain visible when every protocol in the building was designed to make it administrative and forgettable.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

Juno returned from the conference run and had to sit down before the lane finished rebuilding around her.

She was aware of too many things and certain of too few. This was how bleed arrived in mild doses — details grew sharper, then less trustworthy. The world offered more than it could verify. She felt a phantom pinch at the right thumb joint where no thumb existed, and when she pressed the place where the sensation lived, it answered with the particular stubbornness of a body that had decided it was real.

The bleed monitor had already updated.

`Symptom cluster: proprioceptive bleed.`

`Severity: low.`

`Action threshold: sustained narrative pull.`

The phrase *sustained narrative pull* meant the system had classified her fixation as a category of risk — not the fixation on Lena, not the fixation on the archive, but the fixation on a name that appeared in eleven per cent of peripheral entries and had begun to organise her attention around it. Sable was not in the primary recordings. Sable was in the seams between them — in margin notes and observer tags and the pattern of who had adjusted a threshold and who had said *hold* when everyone else had said *cut*.

Juno opened a fresh metadata view across every EN-33 entry she had accessed.

`EN-33-088`: margin note about one person in a kitchen.

`EN-33-089`: maintenance script tagged with `observer priority`.

`EN-33-120`: the restricted entry that had started this cycle.

`EN-33-121`: a private line about a corridor and a reflection.

`EN-33-122`: nothing. No margin. No tag. No trace.

She looked at EN-33-122 too closely and found herself seeing Sable where no note existed — filling the gaps with inference, reading pattern into absence, constructing a presence from the shape of what was missing. The discipline she had built over decades of recovery work was still intact. She could still identify the moment where observation ended and invention began. But the margin between them had narrowed enough that she could feel the friction.

At the edge of the lane, Fen waited with a cup in one hand and concern they were not trying to hide.

"You look like you slept in a memory with no exit," Fen said.

She almost said she was fine.

"Not this cycle," Fen said. "I can see you from here. You've gone from precise to haunted in three minutes."

Juno tried to shape her face into something reassuring and failed. "Just work. Continuity."

Fen studied her with the particular attention of someone who had learned that the first word after *just* was always the lie. "You were never supposed to be that good at pretending."

She asked if Fen had time for an hour. They nodded.

"No full conversation," Fen said. "Just this: if you're reading symbols and calling them instructions, stop. You have too much room in your mind and too little in the chain."

She thanked them and closed the channel. Fen had always been her first witness for things that could not be written in clear language — not because they understood the technical details, but because they understood the cost of carrying technical details alone.

She returned to her lane and composed a status packet for Orin.

`Need witness-side clarification on SABLE references across EN-33 series.`

No response came. Instead, the lane produced a system notice with no author attribution.

`If you need a witness, you cannot make one from a suspect.`

The sentence sat there like a warning written by someone who knew exactly what she was looking for and had decided to tell her she was looking in the wrong place. Or the right place. The distinction had become academic.

She sent Fen the exact coordinates of the maintenance passage she had found, then sent a line she usually erased.

`You were right.`

No response.

She waited. When the waiting became its own kind of work, she opened the restricted metadata tag she had bookmarked: `SABLE-EDGE-INDEX`. The lock gave one warning and then a list.

`Available to witness chain.`

`Missing chain: Lena Orlov.`

`Secondary witness path: Maren.`

The secondary path made no practical sense. Maren had drifted enough that Juno had learned not to make requests in that register anymore. But this was not a request. It was a route — a line of access the archive had preserved because someone in an earlier generation had understood that routes, unlike permissions, could survive institutional silence.

She did not follow the route. Not yet.

She opened a private tracker and wrote the one sentence she could defend to any review chain.

`SABLE references are not the question. The question is who they protect when they turn themselves into footnotes.`

The sentence sat without reply. She had not expected a reply. She had expected the writing of it to ease the pressure, and it had not, because the pressure was not in her thinking. It was in the architecture of her attention, which had reorganised itself around a pattern she could not yet prove and could no longer ignore.

She stood at the lane's edge and looked at the corridor — ordinary, stable, held in shape by collective intention the way all Lattice spaces were held. Nothing in it suggested danger. Nothing in it suggested the presence of a person who had been filed as *observer* in a room that had cleaned its logs and kept one word beneath the attendance list.

Her hands were shaking. The tremor was fine-motor and involuntary, the kind the bleed protocols classified as sympathetic resonance — a body that did not exist remembering the movements of a body it had recently borrowed.

`Symptom note: involuntary fine-motor mimic pattern.`

`No known external cause.`

She closed her eyes and spoke one old calibration sentence.

*Name what is here.*

A lane. A console. A corridor.

No name for the scent that had followed her out of the conference room — warm paper, institutional coffee, the faint singed edge of a room where people had debated the meaning of home while a woman they had tested reported rain in a building she had never visited.

She opened her eyes.

The work had stopped being work three cycles ago. She had known this. She had kept working because the alternative — admitting that her investigation had become a fixation, that her fixation had become a map, that the map was being drawn by the same hand she was trying to find — required a kind of honesty she was not yet prepared to afford.

She sent Orin a second packet.

`Requesting one witness-only pass for EN-33-122. Chain reference: LENA.`

The reply arrived in forty seconds — too fast for deliberation, slow enough for the appearance of it.

`Authorised. One recording. One witness. No extension.`

She accepted before thinking.

The transfer returned her to a room where no tea had ever boiled and no one had ever asked for a cup with a chipped rim. But the recording knew about kitchens, and the recording knew about the sound a person's hands made when they held something they were afraid to set down.

---

<!-- pov: lena -->

The archive room was quiet when Lena entered, because the quiet was hers — she had arrived before the lights and before the screens and before the particular institutional hum that told a room it was expected to perform.

Three monitors sat dark. A notebook lay open on the back shelf. Lena reached for it the way she reached for everything in the last years of the project — with the deliberation of someone who had learned that reaching was the first act of witness, and witness was the first act of cost.

Sable's notation sequence was still in the pages. Not transcribed, not indexed, not filed through any chain the archive would later recognise as official. Written in Sable's hand, in the narrow script that no protocol had approved, folded into the notebook's inner margins where the binding met the page.

Lena did not open the relevant section immediately. She set two mugs on the table — one chipped, one whole. Neither was needed. Both made a room she could recognise as a place where work happened between people rather than to them.

She opened the notebook and read the first visible line.

`I cannot know where the room ends because I have spent years building where it does not.`

The second:

`If we call mercy a feature, we can afford to keep it hidden.`

The third:

`If we call mercy an event, we can finally give it permission.`

Juno stood in the borrowed quiet and held the lines the way a person holds a cup of something too hot to drink. They were not addressed to her. They were not addressed to anyone in particular. They were the private record of a person who had understood that the distance between mercy and policy was not a gap but a decision — a decision someone had made in a room like this one, in a year when decisions still had names and consequences still had faces.

Lena turned the page. The lines were smaller, sharper, written after too much silence and too much coffee.

`We built witness channels because we were afraid to decide for ourselves.`

`We built return loops because we could not agree on what return means.`

`We built Sable because she built the only system we had that knew how to keep a person from dissolving at once.`

`And the one cost of that system is this:`

`We can keep a person long enough that they become less themselves before we admit they were lost.`

Juno felt something in the architecture of her concentration shift — not break, not collapse, but resettle, the way a foundation resettles when the ground beneath it has accepted a new weight. She could file what she had read. She could seal it under commission terms and defer it to the review chain and call that professional discipline. What she could not do was unfeel the particular pressure of standing in a room built by people who had known exactly what they were building and had chosen to build it anyway.

In the corner of her view, a monitor showed a grainy still frame from the old studio. In the frame, at the edge of a doorway, Sable stood with her hands on her hips, looking at a blank board and making a note she did not need anyone to read.

Lena noticed the direction of Juno's — of the borrowed gaze's — attention.

"You see her everywhere now," Lena said.

"No more than that," Juno replied, and did not recognise whether the voice was hers or the recording's. "I see what the room is asking me to see."

Lena gave a tired, exact smile. "Then watch closely. The room is not asking you to be right. It is asking you to stay at the wrong place long enough not to disappear from it."

"That sounds like a warning and a promise."

Lena nodded once. "It's both. We kept both because we could."

The run ended. The room folded into data. The notebook's words followed Juno back through the transfer the way weather follows a person through a doorway — not visible to anyone watching, only present in the way the body moves differently afterward.

---

<!-- pov: juno -->

She returned to a station that held no weather and no evidence of anything she had carried home.

The bleed monitor had updated while she was inside.

`Bleed: sustained.`

`Fixation: active.`

`Warning: symbolic and sensory overlap.`

She read the assessment with the same discipline she applied to every operational fact: clearly, completely, without pretending it described someone else. She was carrying bleed. She was carrying fixation. She was carrying the accumulated weight of two recordings and one notebook and one sentence — *we can keep a person long enough that they become less themselves before we admit they were lost* — and the weight was not metaphorical. It sat in the architecture of her attention the way a stone sits at the bottom of a glass. Everything she observed was now observed through it.

She wrote one line in her local tracker.

`SABLE = witness-pressure source.`

`Need external witness.`

`Do not chase until Lena clears chain.`

She looked at the line and felt tired in the way people are when they have carried all their own instructions too long and none of them have become lighter for the carrying.

The corridor opened and closed with no people inside it. The Lattice adjusted around her — patient, responsive, deaf to everything her attention could not hold.

"I can taste copper when the room gets quiet," she said into the private channel.

Fen answered at once. "That means you've done too much with too little sleep. Or too much with too little separation."

"Come back to a real station. I'll stay with you."

Juno did not answer. She needed still one thing — one detail, one connection — to prove the pattern was not fear in better clothes.

She opened the archive index one final time and found a copied note at the bottom of the Sable edge file. Not locked. Not restricted. Placed in the open, the way someone places a letter on a table for the next person who enters the room.

`If you see me in the background of every room, do not mistake it for obsession.`

`It may be the only place I was ever allowed to stand without dissolving.`

`Witness this room from outside its own appetite.`

She read the note twice and understood, in the practical way she understood all operational facts, that it had been written for someone exactly like her — someone who had followed the marginal references, who had tracked the observer tags, who had begun to see a pattern in the architecture's seams and needed to be told that the pattern was not a symptom but a signal.

She closed the file.

She stood in the lane with her hands open and nowhere to place them.

The choice was clear: she could return to routine and file what she had gathered under the commission's terms, or she could follow the one route the archive had preserved — the route that ran through Lena, through Sable's hidden notations, through the witness chain that connected a notebook written in a year when the future was still being decided by people who could taste their own coffee and feel their own floors.

She chose the route. Not because she trusted Sable. Not because she trusted the archive.

Because she trusted the room less.

And trust, in the Lattice, was the only currency that cost more to keep than to spend.
