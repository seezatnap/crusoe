# Weasleys in San Francisco

## Overview

A Harry Potter fanfiction novel set in the summer between Harry's third and fourth years at Hogwarts (summer 1994). Arthur Weasley wins a Ministry of Magic cultural-exchange lottery and takes the family — plus Harry, freshly rescued from the Dursleys — on a two-week holiday to San Francisco, California. What begins as a chaotic, joyful Weasley adventure through Muggle and magical San Francisco turns dangerous when they stumble into a conflict with a cabal of original dark wizards operating out of the city's hidden magical quarter.

**Canon compliance**: The story is set entirely within the summer gap between *Prisoner of Azkaban* and *Goblet of Fire*. It must not contradict, foreshadow, or interfere with events in the existing books. Sirius Black is on the run but in contact with Harry by owl. Voldemort has not yet returned. Peter Pettigrew has escaped but his whereabouts are unknown. The story is self-contained — the antagonists, their plot, and its resolution exist independently of the series arc.

**Tone**: Matches the tone of the middle books — warm family comedy layered over genuine danger. The Weasley chaos and Harry's wonder at belonging are the emotional core. The threat escalates gradually; the climax should feel earned but not world-ending. Think *Prisoner of Azkaban* energy: mystery, camaraderie, a ticking clock, and emotional stakes rooted in loyalty and identity rather than apocalyptic battle.

**Length target**: 12–15 chapters, each 4,000–6,000 words. Approximately 60,000–80,000 words total.

## Setting

### The Mundane Side

San Francisco in July 1994. The Weasleys experience it as a kaleidoscope of Muggle oddities: cable cars, Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz tours, Chinatown, the fog rolling over the Golden Gate. Arthur Weasley is in paradise — every parking meter, every escalator, every sourdough bread bowl is a miracle to him. The family is staying in a rented Victorian row house in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, arranged through the Ministry's Muggle Liaison Office. The house has been lightly enchanted (Undetectable Extension Charm on the closets, a Floo connection routed through the American Ministry).

### The Magical Side

San Francisco's wizarding community is centered in **Fog Hollow**, a hidden enclave accessible through a warded alley behind a dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. Fog Hollow is a vertical neighborhood built into and around the base of a hill that Muggles perceive as an unremarkable parking structure. Inside, it's a cramped, fog-drenched village of stacked Victorian-style buildings connected by moving staircases and cable-car-like enchanted platforms. The American magical community is less formal than Britain's — no central school like Hogwarts but rather a network of regional academies. The local one, **Coit Academy of Practical Magic**, occupies a building that mirrors the shape of Coit Tower on the mundane side. The American Ministry equivalent is the **Bureau of Magical Affairs (BMA)**, headquartered in Sacramento but with a regional field office in Fog Hollow.

### Key Locations

- **The Haight House**: The Weasleys' rented Victorian. Pale blue with peeling gingerbread trim. The kitchen is the heart of the house; Molly commandeers it immediately. There's a backyard with a lemon tree that Fred and George enchant to throw lemons at passersby.
- **Fog Hollow**: The hidden wizarding quarter. Perpetually misty. Shops include *Pacifica Wands & Curios*, *The Sourdough Cauldron* (pub/restaurant), and *Tidepool Books* (a used magical bookshop where Hermione would lose her mind).
- **Coit Academy**: A summer session is running. The Weasley kids visit and are fascinated/appalled by the differences from Hogwarts (no houses, no Sorting, students call teachers by first names, and there's a mandatory "Muggle Integration" class).
- **The Underlook**: A network of sea caves beneath the cliffs at Lands End, warded and hidden, used historically by smugglers. Now the base of operations for the antagonist cabal.
- **Alcatraz — Magical Wing**: Unknown to Muggles, Alcatraz once housed a small wing for magical prisoners, managed by the BMA. It was decommissioned in 1963 alongside the mundane prison but the old wards remain, and something in the cells still resonates with dark magic.

## Characters

### The Weasley Family

**Arthur Weasley**
Age 44. Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. This trip is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream — Arthur has never been to America and treats every mundane object with rapturous curiosity. He spends an entire afternoon in a Laundromat. He tries to pay for everything with British Muggle money and is baffled by tipping culture. Beneath the comedy, Arthur is perceptive and quietly brave. He notices things the kids miss. When danger comes, he shifts into a calm, competent protector — a reminder that he survived both Wizarding Wars. His wand work is understated but precise.

**Molly Weasley**
Age 43. The gravitational center of the family. She's anxious about the trip from the start — too far from home, too many children to keep track of in a foreign city, and Harry is her responsibility now too. She stress-bakes, producing trays of scones from the Haight House kitchen at all hours. But Molly is also quietly thrilled; she and Arthur haven't had an adventure together since before Bill was born. There are moments — walking the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset, Arthur holding her hand — where the reader sees the young couple they once were. Molly's fierceness in protecting her family is the emotional backbone of the climax.

**Bill Weasley**
Age 23. Curse-breaker for Gringotts, currently on leave between assignments in Egypt. He joins the family trip partly as an extra pair of responsible adult hands, partly because he's never been to San Francisco. Cool, competent, and effortlessly stylish (long hair, fang earring, dragon-hide boots), Bill is the older brother everyone wants to impress. He has professional knowledge of wards and curse-breaking that becomes critical to the plot. He's also the first to sense that something is off about the magical residue at Alcatraz. His relationship with Arthur is warm — they talk like equals now, and Arthur is quietly, enormously proud of him.

**Charlie Weasley**
Age 21. Dragon handler in Romania. Not on the trip — referenced in letters and conversation only. Sends a postcard from a dragon reserve that arrives singed.

**Percy Weasley**
Age 18. Just finished Hogwarts, about to start at the Ministry. Percy is insufferable on the trip — he's drafted a "Cultural Exchange Itinerary" with time-blocked schedules and annotated maps. He lectures everyone on BMA regulations. But he's also deeply insecure about his upcoming Ministry career, and there are vulnerable moments where that cracks through — asking Bill, late at night, whether people at the Ministry will take him seriously. Percy's arc in this story is small but real: he learns to loosen up slightly, and the family sees that his fussiness comes from caring, not contempt.

**Fred and George Weasley**
Age 16. The chaotic heart of the trip. They've smuggled a suitcase full of experimental joke products and are using San Francisco as a testing ground. They enchant a cable car to do loop-de-loops (narrowly reversed by Arthur). They discover Fog Hollow's joke shop and are first horrified (inferior products) then inspired (American magical fireworks). Their subplot involves befriending a local teenage witch, **Marisol Reyes**, who introduces them to American magical culture and becomes a co-conspirator in their pranks. Beneath the comedy, Fred and George are sharp and observant — they notice the antagonists' movements before anyone else because they've been sneaking around Fog Hollow after dark.

**Ron Weasley**
Age 14. Ron is thrilled to have Harry along and terrified of looking poor in front of Americans. He's self-conscious about the family's rented house, their second-hand luggage, his hand-me-down clothes. But San Francisco surprises him — nobody here knows or cares about blood status or family money the way they do at Hogwarts. He starts to relax. His arc is about confidence: when the danger comes, Ron steps up not because he's told to but because he decides to. His chess-player's mind proves critical in figuring out the antagonists' strategy.

**Ginny Weasley**
Age 13. This is post-Chamber of Secrets Ginny — quieter than she used to be, still recovering, but with a steel core forming underneath. She's fascinated by San Francisco's magical community, especially the women she meets in Fog Hollow who are curse-breakers, ward-smiths, and BMA field agents. She starts sketching in a journal (a safe replacement for the diary she'll never touch again) and her drawings become a plot device — she sketches a symbol she sees in Fog Hollow without knowing what it means, and it turns out to be the antagonists' sigil. Ginny's relationship with Harry is still mostly shy admiration, but there are moments of real connection — he's the only other person in the family who knows what it's like to be touched by dark magic.

**Harry Potter**
Age 14 (almost). Rescued from the Dursleys after just two weeks of summer misery. Harry has never been on a family vacation. He has never been to America. He has never been included in the easy, chaotic warmth of a family that simply wants him around. The emotional core of the story is Harry experiencing, for the first time, what it feels like to belong to a family on holiday. He's giddy and overwhelmed and trying not to show it. He keeps expecting to be sent back or told he's in the way. Molly keeps putting food on his plate without being asked. Arthur asks his opinion on Muggle things and actually listens. The Weasley kids treat him like a brother. This is the emotional engine — the danger plot matters because it threatens *this*, the first real family happiness Harry has ever had.

Harry is also still processing the events of third year — Sirius, Lupin, the time-turner, learning his father's friends became Animagi for Remus. He's hopeful about Sirius in a way that makes him vulnerable. He receives owls from Sirius throughout the trip, and the letters are warm but brief (Sirius is hiding in the tropics with Buckbeak). Harry's connection to the antagonist plot comes through his sensitivity to dark magic — he feels the wrongness at Alcatraz before anyone can explain it.

### San Francisco Locals

**Marisol Reyes**
Age 16. A Mexican-American witch and rising sixth-year at Coit Academy. Brash, funny, bilingual (switches between English and Spanish when excited or angry). She grew up in the Mission District, the daughter of a Muggle father (a muralist) and a witch mother (a BMA field agent). Marisol is Fred and George's local guide and partner in crime. She knows every back alley of Fog Hollow and has a talent for enchantment that rivals the twins'. Her mother's BMA connection gives the group access to information about the antagonists. Marisol's arc: she's been coasting on talent and not taking her education seriously; the events of the story show her what magic can do when wielded with intent, both good and terrible.

**Augusto "Gus" Ferreira**
Age 67. A retired BMA field agent, now the owner of *The Sourdough Cauldron* in Fog Hollow. Portuguese-American, born in the Azores, immigrated as a child. Gus is grizzled, kind, and full of stories. He knew the magical Alcatraz wing when it was operational and is one of the few people alive who understands the wards there. He becomes an unlikely ally to Arthur — the two men bond over shared experiences of raising large families and working thankless government jobs. Gus provides exposition about the antagonists' history and the Underlook caves. His personal stake: his late wife, **Eileen**, was a ward-smith who helped decommission the Alcatraz magical wing, and the antagonists' plan involves unraveling her life's work.

**Tomoko "Tomo" Sato**
Age 34. A BMA ward-specialist and field agent assigned to the Fog Hollow office. Japanese-American, third generation, grew up in Sacramento. Precise, professional, and wary of foreign wizards meddling in American magical affairs. Tomo is initially an obstacle — she doesn't want the Weasleys anywhere near the investigation — but she comes to respect their competence, especially Bill's curse-breaking skills. Her arc is about learning to accept help and trust people outside her chain of command. Tomo has a dry wit that pairs well with Bill's easygoing charm, and there's a hint of mutual respect/attraction that never becomes a full subplot (this isn't their story).

### The Antagonists: The Undertow

**The Undertow** is a small cabal of three dark wizards based in San Francisco. They are not Death Eaters, have no connection to Voldemort, and operate entirely within the American magical underworld. Their goal is specific and self-contained: they want to breach the decommissioned Alcatraz magical wing, harvest the residual dark magic trapped in the old prisoner wards, and use it to power a ritual that would grant them control over the fog — specifically, the ability to weaponize San Francisco's natural fog as a medium for mass Obliviation and compulsion. They want to rule Fog Hollow as a private fiefdom, free from BMA oversight.

The Undertow has been operating for about two years, slowly weakening the wards on the Underlook caves (which connect, deep underground, to the foundations of Alcatraz's magical wing via underwater tunnels) and gathering materials. The Weasleys' arrival is a complication they didn't expect — especially when Bill, with his curse-breaker's instincts, starts noticing ward degradation around Fog Hollow.

**Declan Voss** (leader)
Age 52. American, originally from Boston. A former BMA senior agent who was quietly forced out fifteen years ago after an internal investigation revealed he'd been experimenting with compulsion magic on Muggle witnesses during routine Obliviations — not just erasing memories but implanting suggestions, testing how far he could push control. The investigation was buried (the BMA didn't want a scandal), and Voss was given a pension and a non-disclosure agreement. He's been nursing a quiet, corrosive rage ever since. Voss is intelligent, patient, and utterly convinced of his own superiority. He doesn't rant or monologue — he speaks softly, reasons carefully, and is genuinely dangerous because he *understands* institutional magic. He knows how wards work, how the BMA operates, where the blind spots are. His personal philosophy: wizards are wasting their potential by hiding from Muggles when they could be shaping the world. He doesn't want to kill anyone — he wants to *control* them, which is worse. His wand work specializes in compulsion, memory modification, and ward manipulation. He carries a secondary wand (illegal) hidden in a walking stick.

**Isolde Crowe**
Age 45. British-born, emigrated to America at 20 to escape a family entangled with Death Eater sympathizers (her father was a low-level supporter during the first war). Isolde is a potioneer of extraordinary skill — she could have been a Hogwarts professor or a St. Mungo's researcher, but her family name closed those doors. She's bitter, brilliant, and the most sympathetic of the three antagonists. Her motivation is partly ideological (she agrees with Voss that wizards should stop hiding) but mostly personal — she wants recognition, a legacy, proof that she's more than her father's daughter. Isolde is responsible for brewing the ritual components that will allow the fog to carry compulsion magic. She's meticulous and proud of her craft. Her weakness: she has genuine moral lines she won't cross (she won't kill children, she's uncomfortable with Voss's more extreme plans), and this internal conflict becomes a plot lever.

**Harlan Tuque**
Age 38. Canadian, from Newfoundland. A magical smuggler and fence who's been operating on the Pacific coast for a decade. Harlan is the muscle and the logistics — he procures rare ingredients, manages the Underlook cave base, and handles anyone who gets too close. He's cheerful, charismatic, and amoral in a way that reads as almost likeable until you remember what he's enabling. Harlan doesn't care about Voss's philosophy or Isolde's legacy — he's in it for the profit and the thrill. He's an excellent duellist (self-taught, scrappy, no formal training) and specializes in traps, ambushes, and misdirection. His weakness: he's impulsive and overconfident, and he underestimates children. Harlan has a familiar — a massive, ill-tempered pelican named **Barnacle** that he uses for surveillance along the waterfront.

### Relationships and Dynamics

**Arthur & Molly**: The trip rekindles their sense of adventure. There are quiet, lovely moments between them — Arthur buying Molly a flower from a Muggle street vendor, Molly laughing at his excitement over a fire hydrant. But the danger tests them: Molly wants to grab the children and go home; Arthur believes they have a responsibility to help. Their argument about this is one of the story's most emotionally charged scenes.

**Harry & the Weasleys**: Harry is being absorbed into the family. He doesn't have a word for it yet, but this trip is when the Burrow stops being "Ron's house" and starts being "home." Molly fusses over him; Arthur treats him like a seventh son; the twins include him in their schemes; Ginny sits next to him at meals without quite looking at him. Ron, for his part, is fiercely proud that Harry chose to come with them.

**Bill & Percy**: Bill sees Percy's anxiety and doesn't mock it. There's a scene where Bill takes Percy to a bar in Fog Hollow (Percy's first time in a bar) and just talks to him like an adult. Percy, stiff and nervous, slowly unfolds. It's a small scene but it matters.

**Fred & George & Marisol**: A friendship forged in mischief. Marisol shows the twins that American magical culture is different — looser, more improvisational, less bound by tradition — and they show her that British wizards are funnier than she thought. Their prank subplot provides comic relief but also drives the plot: their late-night explorations of Fog Hollow are how the group first discovers the Undertow's activity.

**Ginny & Harry**: Tentative. Ginny is still shy around him, but the trip creates situations where they're thrown together naturally — exploring Fog Hollow, sitting on the Haight House porch at night. Harry starts noticing Ginny as a person rather than "Ron's sister." Nothing romantic happens, but the seeds are planted in a way that's true to the books.

**Gus & Arthur**: An unexpected friendship between two men who've both spent their careers underappreciated by their respective governments. They drink together, swap stories, and discover they have parallel lives. Gus's grief for Eileen gives Arthur a glimpse of what he'd feel if he lost Molly, which strengthens his resolve to protect his family.

**Tomo & Bill**: Professional respect that becomes personal respect. They work together to analyze the ward degradation. Bill impresses Tomo with his expertise; Tomo impresses Bill with her fieldcraft. There's a charged moment during the climax when they save each other's lives. The story leaves their relationship open-ended.

**Voss & Isolde**: A partnership built on shared resentment but fraying. Voss is becoming more extreme; Isolde is having doubts. Their dynamic is the key tension within the antagonist group. Isolde's eventual partial defection (she doesn't switch sides fully, but she refuses to go through with the final step of the ritual when she realizes it would affect children) is the crack that lets the heroes win.

## Plot Structure

### Act One: Arrival (Chapters 1–4)
- Harry is collected from the Dursleys. The family travels by international Portkey to San Francisco.
- The Haight House. Arthur's Muggle explorations. Molly's stress-baking. Fred and George immediately cause problems.
- First visit to Fog Hollow. Introduction of Marisol, Gus, and the American magical world.
- Visit to Coit Academy. Percy's itinerary. Ginny's journal sketching.
- Harry's emotional arc: disbelief, then cautious joy, at being part of this.

### Act Two: Discovery (Chapters 5–8)
- The Alcatraz tour. Harry feels something wrong. Bill notices degraded wards.
- Fred, George, and Marisol's nighttime exploration of Fog Hollow reveals suspicious activity near the waterfront.
- Arthur and Gus bond. Gus shares the history of the magical Alcatraz wing and expresses concern about ward integrity.
- Tomo enters the story — she's been investigating the same ward degradation. Reluctantly accepts help.
- Ginny's sketch of the symbol she saw. Bill recognizes it as a ward-breaking sigil.
- Ron figures out the pattern: the disturbances are connected, moving toward a central point underground. His chess-player mind maps it.
- The Undertow becomes aware that someone is investigating. Harlan begins counter-surveillance. Barnacle the pelican appears in ominous locations.

### Act Three: Confrontation (Chapters 9–12)
- The group locates the Underlook caves. Bill and Tomo explore the outer tunnels and find evidence of ritual preparation.
- Voss confronts the Weasleys indirectly — a compulsion-laced fog rolls through Fog Hollow, causing confusion and memory loss. Arthur and Molly realize this is a preview of what's coming.
- Molly and Arthur's argument: stay and fight, or take the children home. Molly's position is understandable; Arthur's is too. They reach a compromise — the adults will handle it, the kids stay safe.
- The kids, of course, do not stay safe. Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Marisol mount their own investigation and end up in the Underlook.
- Harlan catches them. A tense confrontation. The kids escape using a combination of Fred and George's joke products, Ron's tactical thinking, and Harry's raw magical talent.
- Isolde's crisis of conscience when she realizes children are in danger.

### Act Four: Resolution (Chapters 13–15)
- The full group — Arthur, Bill, Molly, Tomo, Gus, and the kids — converge on the Underlook for the climax.
- Voss begins the fog ritual. The stakes: if it succeeds, all of Fog Hollow falls under compulsion.
- The battle in the caves. Bill and Tomo dismantle the ward anchors. Arthur duels Voss — a quiet, technically brilliant duel between two middle-aged men who understand institutional magic. Molly protects the children with ferocious defensive magic.
- Isolde refuses to complete her part of the ritual. Harlan tries to force the issue and is taken down by Fred, George, and Marisol working together.
- Voss, cornered, attempts a last-ditch compulsion on Harry. Harry's resistance to the Imperius Curse (foreshadowing his fourth year, though he doesn't know it yet) manifests as an instinctive refusal. He throws off the compulsion through sheer willpower.
- The ritual collapses. The caves flood with incoming tide (the wards that held the water back were part of the ritual). The group escapes.
- Aftermath: Voss and Harlan are taken into BMA custody. Isolde cooperates with investigators. Gus begins the work of re-warding Alcatraz with Tomo's help.
- The Weasleys' last day in San Francisco. Emotional farewells. Marisol promises to write to Fred and George. Harry stands on the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset and thinks about the word "home."

## Thematic Threads

1. **Family as shelter and strength**: The Weasleys' love for each other (and for Harry) is the story's heart. The antagonists' philosophy — control over connection — is its inverse.
2. **Belonging**: Harry discovering what it means to be part of a family vacation. Ginny finding her identity after the diary. Marisol figuring out what she wants from her magical education.
3. **Institutional failure**: Both Voss's backstory (the BMA buried his misconduct) and the Weasleys' precarious finances reflect institutions that fail the people they're supposed to serve.
4. **British vs. American magical culture**: Played for comedy and insight. Neither is better; both have blind spots.

---

## Style Notes

- Third-person limited, primarily Harry's POV but with occasional chapters from other perspectives (a Ginny chapter, a Ron chapter, an Arthur chapter at minimum).
- Dialogue-heavy. The Weasleys talk constantly, over each other, in a warm, chaotic family register.
- San Francisco should feel vivid and specific — real streets, real fog, real landmarks, filtered through wizarding perception.
- The humor should be organic, character-driven, and consistent with Rowling's style in books 3–4.
- Dark moments should be genuinely tense without becoming grimdark. No character deaths. Injuries are possible but not permanent.
- Each chapter should have a clear arc and a reason to keep reading.
