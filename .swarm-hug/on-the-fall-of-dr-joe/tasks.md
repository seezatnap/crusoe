## Follow-up tasks (from sprint review)
- [x] (#37) Reconcile status enums across `chapters/README.md`, `writing-artifacts/README.md`, and `writing-artifacts/word-count.md` so blocked/review/finalization states are defined once and used consistently in both templates and tracking rows (`blocked` vs `draft`/`ready_for_review` mismatch). (blocked by #1) (B)
- [x] (#38) Replace the placeholder `CH-000` example in `chapters/README.md` with an explicit “no predecessor” pattern so invalid chapter IDs are not copied into production frontmatter. (blocked by #1) (B)

## Follow-up tasks (from sprint review)
- [x] (#39) Correct the frontmatter example in `chapters/README.md` so the chapter-outline dependency ID/comment matches the canonical map (`DOC-004` for chapter outline, `DOC-005` for mystery architecture) (blocked by #1) (B)
- [x] (#40) Reconcile status vocabulary in `writing-artifacts/README.md` by replacing the artifact comment token `deprecated` with the canonical `archived` value or removing it so all status examples align (blocked by #37) (C)
- [x] (#41) Add the referenced process artifacts or remove dead references in `writing-artifacts/README.md`: `writing-artifacts/dependency-notes.md` and `writing-artifacts/handoff-format.md` (blocked by #1) (C)

## Follow-up tasks (from sprint review)
- [x] (#42) Correct `writing-artifacts/DOC-004-chapter-by-chapter-outline.md` clue-range notation in the “Notation” section to match actual clue IDs used in the outline (`C-001` through `C-073`), since it currently states `C-001` through `C-025`. (blocked by #5) (A)

## Follow-up tasks (from sprint review)
- [x] (#43) Repair `rust/Cargo.toml` workspace configuration so `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace` succeed (currently failing because `rust/crates/*/Cargo.toml` does not exist in the repo). (A)

## Follow-up tasks (from sprint review)
- [ ] (#44) Reconcile Chapter 2 word-count metadata: recalculate `CH-002` and update `word_count_current` in `chapters/CH-002-the-first-ledger.md` plus `LOG-WC-002` `words` and `delta_to_min` in `writing-artifacts/word-count.md` (currently `5222` vs actual `wc -w` result `5219`).
