# On the Fall of Dr. Joe — PRD

## Overview

"On the Fall of Dr. Joe" is a mystery novel comprising 25 chapters. The project requires a multi-sprint approach: early sprints build foundational creative artifacts, and later sprints produce the actual chapter prose.

## Goals

1. Produce a complete, polished 25-chapter mystery novel.
2. Before writing any chapter prose, establish a robust creative foundation through dedicated planning artifacts.
3. Maintain internal consistency across all chapters via shared reference documents.

## Foundational Artifacts (to be produced in early sprints)

- **World Design Document** — Setting, time period, locations, atmosphere, and rules of the world.
- **Character Bible** — Full sketches for every named character: backstory, motivation, relationships, speech patterns, secrets.
- **Plot Outline** — High-level arc covering all 25 chapters: inciting incident, rising action, midpoint reversal, climax, denouement.
- **Chapter-by-Chapter Outline** — For each of the 25 chapters: scene list, POV, key revelations, clue plants, red herrings, emotional beats.
- **Mystery Architecture** — The crime, the clues, the red herrings, the reveal logic, and the fair-play checklist ensuring the reader can solve it.
- **Timeline & Continuity Tracker** — Chronological event timeline ensuring no plot holes.
- **Theme & Motif Guide** — Recurring symbols, thematic threads, and tonal guidelines.

Each of the 25 chapters is its own task. A chapter task means: write the full prose for that chapter, consistent with all foundational artifacts.
