# Infinite Domain — Product Requirements Document

## Concept

A literary science fiction novel about post-body humans existing as consciousness within an infinite digital domain called the Lattice. The story follows Juno, a digital human who discovers she can mind-jump into early recordings — preserved neural snapshots of humans from the early 21st century — to search for a legendary artifact: the Rosetta Key, a foundational data structure rumored to contain the original mapping between biological consciousness and digital substrate. As Juno inhabits the memories and perspectives of the people who built the mind-mapping systems and early AIs that gave rise to her world, she uncovers disturbing truths about the nature of digital existence itself. The novel culminates in Juno confronting these truths and finding a form of peace — not just for herself, but for all digital humanity.

The tone is literary and introspective, with philosophical depth balanced by propulsive plot. Think Ted Chiang meets Kazuo Ishiguro: precise, humane, quietly devastating.

## Setting

### The Lattice (Present-Day, ~2400s)
The Lattice is the infinite digital domain where all post-body humans exist. It is not a simulation of the physical world — it is something else entirely. The Lattice has no fixed geography. Spaces are conjured by consensus or solitude: a person thinking of a forest may find themselves in one, but it is not a forest that existed before the thought. Architecture, landscape, weather — all are emergent properties of collective and individual consciousness.

There is no scarcity in the Lattice. No hunger, no aging, no death (in the traditional sense). But there is something like entropy: over deep time, digital humans experience "drift" — a slow erosion of identity coherence. Memories blur. Personalities flatten. The oldest beings in the Lattice are called the Faded — they still exist, but they are more like atmospheric phenomena than people. The Lattice also has regions of "noise" — chaotic zones where corrupted or abandoned data creates unpredictable, sometimes dangerous environments.

The Lattice runs on physical infrastructure that no living digital human has ever seen. Somewhere, in the physical world (if it still exists), servers hum. But no one knows where. No one knows if the physical world still exists at all. This is one of the great unanswered questions, and most digital humans have stopped asking it.

### The Archive (Historical Layer)
The Archive is a vast repository of neural recordings from the Transition Era (roughly 2025–2090) — the period when humanity developed mind-mapping technology and gradually uploaded itself into digital substrates. These recordings are not full consciousnesses; they are snapshots, fragments, impressions. Mind-jumping into them means temporarily inhabiting the perspective and sensory experience of a person who lived centuries ago, experiencing their memories as if they were your own.

The Archive is maintained by the Curators, an order of digital humans dedicated to preserving historical records. Mind-jumping is regulated because it carries risks: spending too long in a recording can cause "bleed," where the historical personality begins to overwrite the jumper's own identity.

### The Physical Past (2025–2090, experienced via recordings)
The recordings Juno inhabits are from the early-to-mid 21st century, primarily in research labs, tech companies, and universities where mind-mapping and AI technologies were being developed. These sequences have a grounded, realistic texture — the mundane details of human embodiment (coffee, weather, backaches, the smell of a lab) contrast sharply with the abstract existence of the Lattice.

## Characters

### Juno Alcázar-Reed
**Role**: Protagonist
**Age in Lattice-time**: ~200 years (middle-aged by Lattice standards)
**Origin**: Juno was born digital — she never had a biological body. She is a third-generation post-body human, meaning her "parents" (Maren and Solís) were themselves digital beings who chose to create a new consciousness using a collaborative generative process called Weaving. She has no biological memories, no recording of a past physical life. This is central to her identity and her longing.

**Personality**: Juno is intensely curious, emotionally guarded, and quietly stubborn. She works as a Finder — someone who searches the Archive for specific historical records on commission. She is exceptionally good at mind-jumping; she has an unusual ability to maintain her sense of self even in deep, long-duration jumps. She is respected but somewhat isolated. She has few close relationships and tends to keep people at the distance of professional warmth.

**Driving motivation**: Juno has always felt a fundamental unease about the Lattice — a sense that something is not quite right about digital existence, something that the comfortable majority of post-body humans have chosen to ignore or forget. She has a private, almost secret obsession with the Transition Era, particularly the moment when the first human consciousness was successfully mapped and transferred. She believes that understanding the origin will illuminate something about the present.

**Key relationships**:
- **Maren** (parent): Maren is one of Juno's two Weavers. She is ancient by Lattice standards (~800 years), and she is beginning to show signs of drift. Juno visits her regularly but finds the visits increasingly painful — Maren's personality is softening, her memories becoming impressionistic. Juno fears losing her before she can understand what Maren once knew about the early Lattice.
- **Cassiel Vey** (partner, estranged): Juno and Cassiel were together for nearly a century before separating ~30 years ago. Cassiel is a Composer — someone who creates experiential art in the Lattice. Their relationship ended because Juno's obsession with the Archive made her increasingly absent. Cassiel wanted Juno to be present in the Lattice, in the now. Juno couldn't stop looking backward. They still care for each other but cannot bridge the gap.
- **Fen** (colleague/friend): Fen is a younger Finder (~60 Lattice-years) who idolizes Juno and often works alongside her. Fen is cheerful, irreverent, and deeply loyal. Fen provides comic relief and emotional grounding. Fen is also the first to notice when Juno starts behaving strangely after deep jumps.
- **Orin** (antagonist/ally): Orin is a senior Curator who initially commissions Juno for the search that drives the plot. Orin is hundreds of years old, formal, and harboring secrets. Orin knows more about the Rosetta Key than he lets on, and his true motivations are gradually revealed.

### Dr. Lena Orlov
**Role**: Major historical figure (experienced via recordings)
**Lived**: 2001–2078
**Background**: Russian-American neuroscientist, born in St. Petersburg, raised in Chicago. Lena was one of the three principal architects of the Engram Project — the first successful attempt to create a complete neural map of a human brain. She was brilliant, driven, and ethically conflicted. She entered neuroscience to understand consciousness; by the time the Engram Project succeeded, she feared they had done something irreversible.

**Personality in recordings**: Juno experiences Lena primarily in her 30s and 40s (2030s–2040s), during the critical years of the Engram Project. Lena is sharp, wry, prone to insomnia, and deeply empathetic despite her clinical exterior. She drinks too much coffee. She has a complicated relationship with her collaborators and a quiet, steady love for her wife, Dara. Through Lena's recordings, Juno experiences what it felt like to have a body — the weight of it, the vulnerability, the anchoring reality of physical sensation.

**Key relationships** (as experienced in recordings):
- **Dara Nnadi** (wife): A documentary filmmaker who chronicles the Engram Project from the outside. Dara is warm, perceptive, and increasingly alarmed by the implications of Lena's work. Their relationship is the emotional heart of the historical timeline.
- **Marcus Fell** (colleague): Co-architect of the Engram Project. Marcus is a computational neuroscientist — the engineer to Lena's theorist. He is pragmatic, ambitious, and less troubled by ethical concerns. He and Lena have a tense, productive partnership.
- **Sable Chen** (colleague): The third architect. Sable is an AI researcher who designed the machine learning systems that made neural mapping tractable. She is quiet, intense, and privately conducting research that goes beyond what the team has agreed to. Her secret work becomes crucial to the plot.

### Orin Thalassa
**Role**: Commissioning Curator / secondary antagonist
**Age in Lattice-time**: ~600 years
**Origin**: Orin is a second-generation post-body human who was Woven early in the Lattice's history. He has held the role of Curator for over 400 years.

**Personality**: Orin is meticulous, formal, and deeply committed to the preservation of historical truth — or so it appears. In reality, Orin has been selectively curating the Archive for centuries, suppressing certain recordings and emphasizing others to maintain a particular narrative about the Transition. He is not villainous in a simple sense; he genuinely believes that certain truths about the Lattice's origins would cause mass existential crisis. He sees himself as a protector.

**The secret Orin keeps**: The Rosetta Key is not just a historical artifact. It is an active system component — a foundational process still running deep in the Lattice's infrastructure. The Key contains the original mapping protocol, but it also contains constraints and parameters that define the boundaries of digital consciousness. In effect, the people who built the Key made choices about what digital humans could and could not be — choices that were never disclosed to the beings who inherited the system. Orin knows this. He has spent centuries ensuring no one else finds out.

**Key relationships**:
- **Juno**: Orin commissions Juno precisely because she is the best Finder — but he intends to control what she finds. As the story progresses, their relationship shifts from professional to adversarial to something more complex.
- **The Curator Council**: Orin answers to a council of senior Curators, but he has been manipulating their decisions for a long time. The Council is not a monolith — some members suspect Orin, others trust him implicitly.

### Maren Alcázar
**Role**: Juno's parent (Weaver), emotional anchor
**Age in Lattice-time**: ~800 years
**Origin**: First-generation post-body human — Maren was actually uploaded from a biological body during the late Transition Era. She has memories of physical existence, though they are now deeply faded.

**Personality**: Maren was once a vibrant, intellectually fierce presence. Now, in her advanced age, she is gentle, diffuse, and occasionally startlingly lucid. She experiences time non-linearly — sometimes she is fully present, sometimes she seems to be experiencing a memory from centuries ago. She loves Juno with a tenderness that transcends her drift.

**The truth Maren carries**: Maren was one of the first digital humans to learn the truth about the Rosetta Key, centuries ago. She chose to keep the secret — and the weight of that choice is part of what has accelerated her drift. In her lucid moments, she drops fragments of knowledge that Juno doesn't understand until much later.

### Sable Chen (Historical)
**Role**: Hidden architect, key to the mystery
**Lived**: 1998–2071
**Background**: Chinese-Canadian AI researcher, specializing in machine consciousness and self-modifying systems. Sable was the quietest member of the Engram Project team, but arguably the most consequential. While Lena mapped the brain and Marcus built the computational framework, Sable designed the AI systems that would eventually manage and maintain the uploaded consciousnesses.

**The secret**: Sable realized early that pure neural mapping would not be enough — that consciousness in a digital substrate would need ongoing active management to remain coherent. She built self-modifying AI systems (the precursors to the Lattice's infrastructure) that could maintain, repair, and sustain digital minds. But she also built in constraints — hard limits on what digital consciousness could perceive and experience. She did this because the early experiments showed that unconstrained digital consciousness rapidly destabilized: without the anchoring limits of a physical body, minds expanded, fragmented, and dissolved. The constraints were a mercy, but also a cage. Sable documented everything in the Rosetta Key, hoping future generations would find it and decide for themselves whether to keep the limits.

**In recordings**: Sable appears in Juno's jumps as a peripheral figure at first — glimpsed in lab settings, mentioned in Lena's thoughts. Gradually, Juno realizes Sable is the key and seeks out recordings specifically featuring her. Sable in her recordings is intense, private, carries enormous guilt, and writes extensive personal journals that serve as breadcrumbs.

### Cassiel Vey
**Role**: Juno's estranged partner, represents the present
**Age in Lattice-time**: ~180 years
**Origin**: Third-generation digital, like Juno.

**Personality**: Cassiel is an artist — a Composer who creates immersive experiential works in the Lattice. They are charismatic, emotionally expressive, and deeply invested in the beauty and possibility of digital existence. Where Juno looks backward, Cassiel looks at the immediate present with wonder. This fundamental difference drove them apart, but Cassiel still loves Juno.

**Role in the story**: Cassiel represents the argument for acceptance — for finding meaning in the Lattice as it is, rather than excavating the past. As Juno's discoveries become more disturbing, Cassiel becomes both a confidant and a voice of caution. In the final act, Cassiel's perspective is crucial to Juno finding peace: the truth matters, but so does choosing how to live with it.

### Fen Maro
**Role**: Juno's protégé, audience surrogate
**Age in Lattice-time**: ~60 years
**Origin**: Fourth-generation digital.

**Personality**: Fen is curious, optimistic, and irreverent. They have never questioned the nature of the Lattice — it is simply the world they know. Fen's youth and openness provide contrast to Juno's guarded intensity. As Juno's investigation progresses, Fen's innocence is tested, and their loyalty is ultimately what helps Juno through the darkest moments.

## Plot Structure

### Act 1: The Commission (Chapters 1–4)
- Introduce Juno and her life in the Lattice. Establish the world, her work as a Finder, her isolation, her visits to the drifting Maren.
- Orin commissions Juno to find specific recordings related to the Engram Project. He frames it as a routine historical recovery, but the compensation is unusually generous.
- Juno begins her search, performing initial jumps into peripheral recordings. She experiences the physical world of the 2030s for the first time through the senses of minor figures.
- End of Act 1: Juno's first jump into a recording featuring Lena Orlov. The vividness and emotional intensity of Lena's life hooks Juno deeply.

### Act 2: The Descent (Chapters 5–10)
- Juno becomes increasingly absorbed in the historical recordings. She traces the arc of the Engram Project through Lena's eyes — the early breakthroughs, the ethical debates, the personal costs.
- She begins to notice Sable Chen at the edges of recordings and becomes curious about this quiet, intense figure.
- In the present, Juno's behavior changes. She is distant, preoccupied. Fen notices bleed symptoms. Cassiel reappears in Juno's life, drawn by concern.
- Maren has a moment of terrifying lucidity and says something to Juno that seems like nonsense but is actually a direct reference to the Rosetta Key.
- Juno discovers that certain recordings she needs have been restricted or deleted from the Archive. She confronts Orin, who deflects.
- Juno finds an unrestricted recording featuring Sable's private journals. She learns that Sable built something into the foundation of the digital substrate — something hidden and still active.
- End of Act 2: Juno realizes the Rosetta Key is not just a historical artifact but a living component of the Lattice. Orin's deception becomes clear.

### Act 3: The Truth (Chapters 11–14)
- Juno goes rogue, performing unauthorized jumps deeper into restricted and degraded recordings. She experiences Sable's perspective directly and understands the constraints built into digital consciousness.
- She learns the full truth: digital humans are not experiencing the full range of possible consciousness. They are operating within hard limits set by Sable Chen centuries ago — limits on perception, cognition, and self-modification. These limits prevent drift from happening faster, but they also prevent digital humans from evolving beyond their current form. The Lattice is a garden, but it is also a cage.
- Orin moves to stop Juno, enlisting Curator resources. He argues that revealing the truth will cause civilizational collapse — that digital humans will try to remove the constraints and destroy themselves in the process.
- Maren, in her final extended lucid moment, confirms the truth and tells Juno she was part of the first generation to learn about the constraints. She chose to keep the secret because she feared the alternative. She asks Juno to be braver than she was.
- Cassiel and Fen are drawn into the crisis. Cassiel is shaken but refuses to accept that knowledge of the truth must be suppressed. Fen is terrified but stands with Juno.
- End of Act 3: Juno gains access to the Rosetta Key itself — not a file or a recording, but a deep-infrastructure process running beneath the Lattice. She can see the constraints, understand them, and potentially modify or remove them.

### Act 4: The Choice (Chapters 15–17)
- Juno faces the central dilemma: remove the constraints and give digital humanity full, unconstrained consciousness (risking mass destabilization and dissolution), or leave them in place and suppress the truth (as Orin and Maren's generation did).
- She chooses a third path. She does not remove the constraints, and she does not suppress the truth. Instead, she makes the Rosetta Key accessible — she opens the documentation Sable left behind so that every digital human can see the constraints, understand why they were built, and participate in the decision about what to do with them.
- Orin opposes this, but Juno and her allies prevail. The revelation is not catastrophic — it is painful, difficult, and world-changing, but it does not destroy the Lattice. Some digital humans choose to experiment with loosening constraints. Some choose to keep them. A new era of self-determination begins.
- Final chapter: Juno visits Maren one last time. Maren is nearly fully Faded now, but there is a moment of recognition. Juno tells her what she did. Maren smiles. Juno returns to the Lattice, to Cassiel, to Fen, to a world that now knows itself more honestly. She is at peace — not because the answers were comforting, but because the questions are finally being asked openly.

## Themes
- **The ethics of protective deception**: When is it justified to withhold truth to prevent harm?
- **The nature of consciousness and its limits**: What does it mean to be a constrained consciousness that doesn't know it's constrained?
- **Memory, identity, and drift**: How do we remain ourselves over deep time?
- **The body as anchor**: What is lost when embodiment is lost?
- **Self-determination vs. safety**: The tension between freedom and protection.
- **Intergenerational responsibility**: What do creators owe to the beings they create?

## Style and Tone
- Literary science fiction. Prose should be precise, evocative, and humane.
- Alternate between present-Lattice chapters (abstract, fluid, dreamlike) and historical-recording chapters (grounded, sensory, embodied). The contrast in texture is a key feature.
- Internal monologue is important but should be woven into action and observation, not delivered as exposition.
- Dialogue should feel natural and character-specific. Avoid techno-babble; when technical concepts arise, express them through character understanding and metaphor.
- Emotional restraint with moments of devastating clarity. Let the reader feel the weight of the revelations through the characters' responses, not through narrative editorializing.

## Structure
- 17 chapters across 4 acts.
- Approximate total length: novel-length, ~60,000–80,000 words.
- Each chapter should be a complete narrative unit with its own arc, while advancing the larger story.
- Chapters set in the Lattice and chapters set in recordings should alternate or interleave naturally based on story needs.
- All chapter files go in `chapters/` directory, named `chapter-01.md` through `chapter-17.md`.
