# Summer 1994 World and Setting Bible

Task: (#4) Create the world and setting bible for all locations: Haight House, Fog Hollow, Coit Academy, the Underlook, Alcatraz magical wing, and mundane SF landmarks. Include local magical laws, BMA structure, transportation, and cultural differences from British wizarding world.

## 0) Baseline and Boundaries

- **Canonical window:** summer 1994, post-*Prisoner of Azkaban* and pre-*Goblet of Fire* consequences, aligned with `summer-1994-canonical-timeline-and-compliance-matrix.md`.
- **Magic baseline:** fully magical in a hidden, coexistence-dependent mode: normal city life is preserved, while enchanted systems run quietly in parallel.
- **Design rule:** any magical infrastructure in San Francisco is built to avoid broad visibility and is denser, more improvisational, and more locally adapted than central UK wizarding systems.
- **Tone rule:** the city feels alive, specific, and materially weathered by fog, salt air, and history. The magical and muggle layers should feel like two cities sharing the same streets with different lights.

## 1) Location Bibles

### 1.1 Haight House (Weasley Family Residence)

- **Location:** rented Victorian row house in Haight-Ashbury, close enough to Summer Street and Haight Street traffic that Arthur can pretend he is “in the thick of ordinary human life” every day.
- **Exterior profile:** pale blue wood siding, decorative trim, peeling but sturdy gingerbread edges, chipped paint that would normally read neglected but in this world reads “full of history.”  
- **Layout and magical modifications:**
  - **Kitchen:** family heart and command center. Molly’s temporary enchantments (self-regulating oven, anti-stick rune, spice-bowl charms) are noisy enough to trigger local muggle alarms if overused, so she avoids showy defensive loops and uses low-level charms.
  - **Closets and storage:** discreet Undetectable Extension Charms with strict runes that auto-collapse at exactly the same minute every hour to avoid suspicious muggle energy signatures.
  - **Basement:** lightly warded for damp and heat fluctuations from nearby fog currents. Arthur forbids Marvellous-Mixed-Pigeon-loud protection loops, preferring utility wards.
  - **Porch and backyard:** lemon tree with a family enchantment, practical anti-thief and comic deterrent layers; in-world use as recurring family comic beat and later as improvised anti-surveillance cover.
  - **Floo route:** one sanctioned branch route to a US-sourcing fireplace in Arthur’s office; access is through an old, narrow keyhole chimney that requires a verbal passphrase and a short verification trace.
  - **Security posture:** intentionally low; the house is not a fortress. Its enchantments are designed for comfort and concealment, not hard defense.
- **Narrative functions:**
  - Domestic baseline for family chemistry and belonging arc.
  - First place characters feel “safe,” then realize safety is relative after magical developments.
  - Contrast between British household improvisation and West Coast living patterns.

### 1.2 Fog Hollow (American Wizarding Quarter)

- **Public muggle view:** parking structure and back lane access behind a Chinatown storefront.
- **Reality:** layered underground and vertical district, with stacked facades and fog-filtered courtyards built into alley geometry and hillside grade.
- **Access model:**
  - Entry requires one-pass ward rhythm, usually as a short phrase spoken at a hidden doorframe and/or a token object exchange.
  - Late-night wards shift in fog density and are more prone to drift; locals carry backup transposition sigils.
  - Non-witches and unlinked adults cannot remain inside long periods without registering with the local field office.
- **Core districts:**
  - **Merchants’ lanes:** wand shops, repair benches, potion stores, enchantment brokers, and contraband-curbed curio shops.
  - **Night market platforms:** moving stairways, rope-lift charms, and fog-lift carts for people unable to Apparate safely in low visibility.
  - **Conclave squares:** neutral gossip zones with low-level anti-recording wards; no one can cast for record beyond five minutes without formal authorization.
- **Cultural note:** this is less ceremonial than UK wizard hubs; it is pragmatic and commercially aggressive, with stronger local trade guild identities and quicker social mobility.
- **Story significance:** central contact web for Marisol, Gus, and Tomo; place where British assumptions break.

### 1.3 Coit Academy of Practical Magic

- **Placement:** above the city in appearance, built to echo Coit Tower profile while its deeper structure is hidden and modular.
- **Institutional model:** a regional academy and practical training center, not a boarding house and not strictly a school clone.
- **Academic structure:**
  - No Hogwarts-style house system.
  - No Sorting; enrollment is by age and previous schooling equivalence.
  - Students are treated as cohorts by practical track:  
    1. Foundational Arcana  
    2. Urban Warding  
    3. Artifact and Repair  
    4. Practical Defense and Emergency Magic  
    5. Muggle Integration and Etiquette
- **Pedagogy differences:**
  - Teachers commonly use first-name address; hierarchy is present but less formal.
  - Coursework emphasizes local hazard response: fog acoustics, damp wards, waterfront wards, urban concealment.
  - Field modules happen in city-adjacent safe zones with controlled exposure.
- **Reputation risk:** students are encouraged to “fail loudly” in simulation environments rather than hide errors. This makes them adaptable but blunt-edged.
- **Narrative function:** visible contrast with Hogwarts; key to introducing local norms, bureaucracy, and discipline differences.

### 1.4 The Underlook (Sea-Cave Network)

- **Location:** beneath Lands End and into old cliff systems; tidal access points are disguised as derelict service areas.
- **History:** former smuggling corridor later repurposed by fringe magical operators and, at various times, unofficial warding experiments.
- **Spatial logic:**
  - Maze-like tunnel branches with vertical shafts and tidal chambers.
  - Old BMA maintenance booms remain in place near lower galleries; many are rusted but still keyed.
  - Sound behaves oddly: voices compress and carry; this supports ambush scenes and confusion beats.
- **Hazards:**
  - Salt-laced condensation undermines unmaintained runes.
  - Tidal surge pulses at certain moon phases.
  - Blind dead-zones where charms drop half-seconds and compulsion anchors rebound.
- **Security profile:**
  - Weakly mapped by official channels; high uncertainty.
- **Narrative significance:** primary operational threat zone and climax setting; ideal for tactical movement and moral choice scenes.

### 1.5 Alcatraz Magical Wing (decommissioned)

- **Operational history:** former BMA-restricted wing that handled high-risk magical prisoners prior to decommission in 1963.
- **Current status in 1994 story:** officially closed to the public and largely mothballed, with many wards still keyed and partially active.
- **On-site details:**
  - Concentric ward rings still map to old cells.
  - Primary breach point sits near western service corridor, often blamed on weather seepage.
  - Old anti-escape runes were never fully dismantled, leaving unpredictable resonant pockets.
- **Known resonance:** residual dark-trace pressure in old confinement nodes, interpretable as memory of repeated coercive rituals, not active spell stock.
- **Narrative function:** symbolic scar in magical governance; source of the antagonist’s operational plan and a place where old institutional failure becomes physically present.

### 1.6 Mundane San Francisco Landmarks and Their Magical Counterpoints

- **Haight-Ashbury:** open-air family scenes, neighborhood texture, and local magical concealment opportunities.
- **Chinatown/Chinatown alleys:** dual-use corridors; muggle and magical access points overlap, making it a practical portal district.
- **Fisherman’s Wharf / Pier 39:** daytime crowd cover and nighttime ward-drift zones where charm residuals behave unpredictably near salt and commercial heat.
- **Golden Gate Bridge:** recurring visual and emotional line for belonging; also a major compass line for spell-noise refraction under heavy fog.
- **Lombard Street and cable-car routes:** key to Arthur’s muggle wonder beats; good for transit logistics and accidental magical entanglement.
- **Sausalito/Ferry crossings:** magical transport alternative and a place where fog-lift and tidal conditions matter.
- **Lands End / Cliff trails:** route to the Underlook; unstable terrain and wind-lane enchantment noise.
- **Alcatraz Island tour circuit:** ordinary tourism flow masks low-level magical reconnaissance opportunities; key location for first anomaly detection by Harry and Bill.

## 2) Local Magical Laws and Administrative Norms

### 2.1 Core legal regime

- **Non-interference standard:** magic that causes a clearly muggle-visible effect without direct necessity is handled as a civil violation, with escalating penalties.
- **Registration and identity:** long-term visiting wizards require temporary registration with field BMA office for legal protections and incident response.
- **Arcane possession laws:** certain wards and compulsion compounds are controlled objects; possession is legal under license only.
- **Public Compulsion ban:** non-emergency compulsion, suggestion, or memory alteration in public settings is prosecutable unless under BMA mandate.
- **Wards near Muggle civic infrastructure:** high scrutiny if they interfere with transit, health, fire, or harbor routes.

### 2.2 Enforcement culture

- Penalties are less theatrical than UK equivalents; emphasis is on de-listing, immediate remediation, and remedial training.
- Repeat offenders can be temporarily restricted from urban wards and forbidden from operating in Fog Hollow zones.
- The BMA prefers evidence packages over loud court drama: formal hearings are practical, not ceremonial.

### 2.3 UK vs. San Francisco legal culture difference

- In the UK, tradition and hierarchy are stronger; in San Francisco, enforcement is more municipal and incident-driven.
- Local BMA agents prioritize measurable damage and public risk over strict class protocol.
- “Intent” is weighed heavily; practical improvisation and local knowledge can mitigate punishment if it reduces collateral harm.

## 3) BMA Structure (San Francisco Focus)

### 3.1 Ministry-level

- **Bureau of Magical Affairs (BMA):** American counterpart to the UK Ministry for magical civil administration.
- **National headquarters:** Sacramento (strategic, policy, archives, legal authority).
- **Regional liaison model:** branch offices handle localized enforcement, registry, and incident response.

### 3.2 Fog Hollow Field Office (1994)

- **Command:** one senior field controller, one legal liaison, several rotating agents.
- **Units:**
  - **Concealment and Access Unit:** maintains gate integrity, anti-exposure audits.
  - **Ward Integrity Unit:** inspects structural wards, waterfront routes, and legacy enchantments.
  - **Incident Response Unit:** rapid response for breach, compulsion events, and transit incidents.
  - **Civic Interface Cell:** handles accidental muggle sightings, complaint intake, and local merchant mediation.
- **Operational style:** lower ceremony than Ministry offices in the UK; faster authorization for short-range operations, tighter oversight on external partnerships.

### 3.3 Internal political texture

- **Reputation pressure:** no one wants the American wizarding public to repeat “institutional negligence” headlines, so field operations are often quietly overcorrected.
- **Professional friction:** legacy investigators and younger operators disagree on openness vs. containment; this can produce delayed responses and protocol conflict.
- **External trust profile:** locals trust practical competence more than rank, so personal reputation matters in field command.

## 4) Transportation Model (Magical and Mundane)

### 4.1 Daily transport

- **Mundane first:** cable cars, buses, BART, sidewalks, cable-stair systems, ferries, and city rental cars. This grounds Arthur’s tourism arc and offers visibility into local life.
- **Walking reality:** dense routes mean most young people move through mixed terrain on foot; magical alternatives are used for speed and emergency.

### 4.2 Wizardly movement options

- **Apparition (coastal constraints):** works but less reliable in dense fog and around metallic-rich seawall zones.
- **Floo:** available but less common to UK standards; often limited to fixed nodes and emergency permits.
- **Portkeys:** legal route control is strict; tourists and visitors can use pre-cleared routes only.
- **Transfiguration-based shortcuts:** preferred by some local operatives for short hops; legality depends on corridor usage and witness exposure.
- **Flying/Familiar movement:** rare; usually reserved for reconnaissance and covert ops.

### 4.3 Strategic movement in key arcs

- **Fog Hollow to Haight House:** usually walk + tram + short transit corridor rather than magical teleport for stealth and plausibility.
- **Underlook/Alcatraz ops:** multi-stage movement with mixed transit (boat access + tunnel transit + foot) to reduce sensory signatures.
- **Field response pattern:** BMA uses predictable muggle routes first; magical shortcuts only when casualties or compulsion escalation justify it.

## 5) Cultural Differences: British Wizarding World vs. SF/American Practice

1. **Hierarchy and formality**
   - UK settings rely on tradition and formal titles.
   - SF settings are more horizontal, practical, and first-name-driven even among authority figures.
   - Story effect: the Weasleys initially over-defer or over-correct.

2. **Institutional behavior**
   - UK: ceremony, formality, archival procedure.
   - SF: short incident memos, rapid fixes, and pragmatic de-escalation.
   - Story effect: fewer grand speeches, more blunt practical trade-offs.

3. **Education style**
   - UK model is house-driven identity and legacy curriculum.
   - Coit model is cohort tracks, performance-based placement, and practical city-specific fieldwork.
   - Story effect: Harry and the Weasleys sense unfamiliar confidence patterns in American youth.

4. **Risk and secrecy ethics**
   - UK often prefers controlled secrecy and status-preserving discretion.
   - Fog Hollow culture treats secrecy as adaptive, not absolute, especially if local safety requires controlled transparency.
   - Story effect: characters must decide when to disclose dangers to non-magical partners and neighbors.

5. **Humor and social rhythm**
   - UK banter can be formal with irony.
   - SF magical speech is faster, often commercial, more performative, and less deferential.
   - Story effect: Peruvian/French pastries may be exchanged with an offhand line; Fred/George mischief lands differently in American ears.

6. **Relationship to Muggle infrastructure**
   - UK families often treat local Muggle objects as curiosities, then integrate.
   - Arthur’s family must actively study American systems as sacred objects of wonder.
   - Story effect: muggle-technology scenes are emotionally intimate, not just exposition.

## 6) Operational Continuity Notes for Plot

- **For Foreshadowing:** use each location as a distinct pressure zone:
  - Haight House = domestic normalcy and emotional safety.
  - Fog Hollow = cultural discovery and first anomaly.
  - Coit Academy = institutional contrast and skill framing.
  - Underlook = subterranean strategy and escalating threat.
  - Alcatraz = institutional legacy and core danger source.
  - SF landmarks = grounding and public-scale exposure stakes.
- **For consistency:** avoid implying that Hogwarts-style laws automatically apply in the U.S.; legal and social rules differ by jurisdiction.
- **For mystery logic:** ritual mechanics should tie to location-specific details (fog acoustics, damp resonant wards, tide pressure, legacy confinement wards).
- **For character behavior constraints:** keep Arthur’s practical optimism, Percy’s bureaucratic certainty, and the twins’ adaptive improvisation believable in a system where rule-bending is common but still monitored.
