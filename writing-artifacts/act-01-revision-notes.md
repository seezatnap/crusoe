# Act 1 Revision Notes — Task #25

## Scope
- Chapters reviewed and revised: 01–05
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Word-count verification
- chapter-01.md: 5,756
- chapter-02.md: 4,224
- chapter-03.md: 4,275
- chapter-04.md: 5,997
- chapter-05.md: 5,776

All five chapters are within the 4,000–6,000 target.

## Verification outcomes

### 1) POV consistency
- Ch. 1–4 remain Harry-focused interiority and externalized observations.
- Ch. 5 remains Ginny-centered with occasional observation of Harry/others.
- No POV drift introduced by this pass.

### 2) Comedic pacing
- Chapter 4 and 5 continue to alternate comic beats with tonal pivots.
- Added small grounding beats to keep humor from overriding threat escalation: chapter 4 opening now anchors domestic continuity, and chapter 5 adds muted observational beats before/after the Coit class.

### 3) Canon compliance
- No additions referencing post-1994 canon events (e.g., confirmed Voldemort return, Goblet of Fire outcomes, or later tournament knowledge).
- No contradiction introduced against the summer 1994 window or character knowledge constraints.

### 4) Continuity across chapters
- Continuity reinforcement edits added:
  - Ch. 4 opening now ties the fog/house hum anomaly to prior chapters while shifting it into a managed rhythm.
  - Ch. 5 ending now mirrors chapter 1–2 home-integration arc by moving Harry from guarded observer to included family participant.

### 5) Emotional arc progression
- Arc markers reinforced:
  - Harry: from guarded arrival anxiety to active participation and family inclusion.
  - Ginny: from private observation to pattern-recognition responsibility.
  - Ron/Household: uncertainty remains grounded by practical support.
