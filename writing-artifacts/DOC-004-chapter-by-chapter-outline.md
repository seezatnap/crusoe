## Notation

- **Clue IDs:** `C-001` through `C-073`.

## Chapter 01 — The Locked Room at Hallowford House

### Scene Sequencing
1. **Fog dawn discovery:** Inspector Pencombe arrives at Hallowford House to find Joe Hale dead in a room with no obvious sign of entry.
2. **Room sweep and scene lock:** Pencombe, Vale, and staff document key locks, weather effects, and time markers.
3. **Household first-pass interviews:** Margaret, Clara, and Evelyn provide initial timelines and social constraints.
4. **Police dispatch and corridor map:** station receives first external pressure and starts first hypothesis board.

### POV Map
- Scene 1: Inspector Celia Pencombe  
- Scene 2: Sergeant Vale (supporting tactile observations)  
- Scene 3: Margaret Hale  
- Scene 4: Inspector Pencombe / Vale (procedural duet)

### Key Revelations
- The room is effectively sealed; no obvious forced-entry path.
- The death window overlaps the late-storm period when travel and visibility were constrained.
- Initial police pressure is social as much as procedural: reputation risk can shape testimony.

### Clue Placements
- **C-001** — A folded note fragment in Joe’s coat pocket with a clinic-side notation.
- **C-002** — Side keyhole shows damp sealing paste, implying recent tampering.
- **C-003** — Bell schedule mismatch: house bell expected twice before dawn, heard once by one witness.

### Red Herrings
- Household rumor that Joe suffered a private breakdown and self-harmed.
- Misleading suggestion that a dockside intruder entered through a broken shutter (physically impossible in recorded weather).

### Emotional Beats
- Public shock, private fear; family discipline vs investigation demands.
- Pencombe resists social pressure and keeps objective language.
- End beat: the locked-room premise is established as a technical problem, not a melodrama.

### Scene Sequencing
1. **Clock-and-tide reconstruction:** Pencombe narratively replays the murder window.
2. **Movement simulation:** route, bell, tram, and storm-lag constraints are tested.
3. **Suspect opportunity elimination:** each candidate’s timeline is invalidated.
4. **Evidence convergence note:** only orchestrated dual-access suspects remain.

### POV Map
- Scene 1: Inspector Pencombe  
- Scene 2: Sergeant Vale  
- Scene 3: Inspector Pencombe  
- Scene 4: Margaret Hale / Gideon (intercut as needed for emotional responses)

### Key Revelations
- The culprit had a narrow movement corridor requiring both key duplicate and prepositioned medicine access.
- Several previously credible alibis fail under weather-timing reality.
- The locked-room frame is fully explained by timing choreography.

### Clue Placements
- **C-062** — Bell register + storm log triangulates exact 11-minute transfer window.
- **C-063** — Tracked tram delay removes one suspect and confirms another.
- **C-064** — Corridor draft from Pencombe’s board showing sequence lockup.

### Red Herrings
- Human memory uncertainty is initially blamed for all contradictions.
- Claim that weather itself killed witness reliability is insufficient against logs.

### Emotional Beats
- Readers and characters face irreversible narrowing.
- Pencombe’s control peaks; Vale’s nervousness becomes focused, not random.
- End beat: the story enters pre-climax pressure mode.

2. **Press and public reaction:** newspaper and civic voices pivot toward correction.

- **C-068** — Municipal corrections begin to align with sealed case statements.
- **C-069** — Staff and household role statements are documented as official addenda.
- **C-070** — Motif-driven closure object: fog lifts briefly as archive doors open.

### Red Herrings
- Speculation that all culpability rests on one weak link rather than coordinated planning.
- Press overcorrects into punitive spectacle, delaying healing.

### Emotional Beats
- Grief becomes administrative and civic, not theatrical.

### Red Herrings
- Late speculation of a single “villain fantasy” without system accountability.
- Rumors that Joe’s efforts had to remain secret forever.

### Emotional Beats

## Cross-Chapter Continuity Notes (for DOC-005 and DOC-006 alignment)

- Chapter-to-chapter suspense escalates from locked-room mechanism (access uncertainty) to suppression architecture (documents and legal delay).
- Clue economy should remain fair-play: every critical reveal appears with at least two discoverable supports.
- Red herrings are strongest when they align with class bias or procedural complexity; they must be emotionally believable before being resolved.
- Emotional progression by act:
  - Ch. 1–8: social shock and procedural shock.
  - Ch. 9–16: evidence accumulation through logistics and motive.
  - Ch. 17–22: hard narrowing through mechanics and timing.
  - Ch. 23–25: confession-by-sequence, public consequence, and moral settlement.
- Maintain motif cadence from `DOC-007`: fog/clock/records/key/ledger/telegraph/medicine should recur with escalating function.
