# Summer 1994 Canonical Timeline & Compliance Matrix

Task: 
#1 Create a canonical timeline and compliance matrix for the summer 1994 gap: Sirius on the run, Pettigrew escaped, no Voldemort return, no contradictions with books 1–4. Include enforceable do-not-cross rules for canon events and character knowledge.

## Canonical window (hard boundary)
- **Start boundary:** immediate post-*Prisoner of Azkaban* summer, after Hogwarts closes and before the normal late-August Hogwarts re-enrollment phase.
- **End boundary:** **before any named events of *Goblet of Fire* beyond the 1994 summer term reset** (no post-term outcomes, no tournament outcomes, no Voldemort return sequence).
- **Default setting assumptions:** San Francisco trip occurs while Harry is still effectively in summer break and while Sirius is still fugitive and actively avoiding Ministry sight.

## 1994 Summer timeline anchors (book 1–4 compliant)

| Period | Canon anchor | Required interpretation in this project | Non-negotiables |
|---|---|---|---|
| June 1994 (end of school year, immediate fallout of OotP) | Sirius and Sirius's ally Peter Pettigrew escape from Azkaban; Sirius remains hunted and in hiding. | Begin the story with this status as established fact. | Never depict Sirius as imprisoned, dead, publicly exonerated, or safely recovered. |
| July 1994 | Harry is in summer limbo after liberation from Dursley custody and before return to school. | Summer trip to the U.S. must be framed as a pre-*Goblet of Fire* vacation with no Hogwarts conflict ongoing. | Do not reference post-Goblet institutional changes, international tournament preparation, or Crouch family unraveling.
| July–August 1994 | Harry turns 14 on July 31. | Character ages, schooling expectations, and family dynamics remain consistent with “pre-4th-year summer.” | Keep Harry and peers at ages/skill level equivalent to start of book 4; no post-OY/O.W.L.-style advancement of relationships/skills beyond canon. |
| Mid to late summer 1994 (pre-Hogwarts return) | Ministry is still operating with Voldemort presumed dead; no public recovery of Crouch Jr.; no confirmed Dark Lord comeback in canon timeline yet. | It is legal for characters to sense unease or encounter dark residue, but not to know Voldemort has returned. | Never make Voldemort’s return or any direct fourth-year tournament climax consequence active in this interval. |
| Immediate lead-up to Hogwarts return | All canon events that drive book 4 begin in the UK in the weeks after summer. | Story must hand back continuity cleanly at the start of book 4. | Avoid ending with outcomes that rely on future book-4 events (e.g., Crouch Jr.'s public exposure, Triwizard results, Hogwarts attack aftermath). |

## Canon compliance matrix

### A) State integrity matrix

| Item | Canon fact required | Allowed in this interval | Enforceable check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sirius status | On the run; not in custody; not confirmed safely captured | Mentioned as fugitively protected, communicating when possible but not fully accessible | Any scene with Sirius imprisoned, dead, publicly celebrated, or under trial is a hard fail |
| Pettigrew status | Escaped | Pettigrew is missing/at large; treated as “alive but fugitive/hidden” only in implication | Any line of text asserting Pettigrew is in Azkaban or definitively dead is a hard fail |
| Voldemort arc | No confirmed return yet in canon for this interval | Rumors about old enemies or dark instability are permissible if presented as rumor/intuition | Any confirmed knowledge of Voldemort’s return is disallowed; any successful use of post-return canon institutions/events is disallowed |
| Triwizard arc | Not yet resolved (and in this summer window, not yet unfolding) | Can reference that a school-year event is upcoming in broad terms only | Naming the Cup outcome, champions, task outcomes, dragons, maze, or tournament aftermath is disallowed |
| Schooling arc | Fourth year is still forthcoming | Harry and peers still at beginning-of-year emotional/school baseline | References to book-4 major consequences (post-tournament injuries, major institutional fallout) are disallowed |

### B) Character knowledge matrix

| Character group | What they may know in this story | What they must not know |
|---|---|---|
| Harry | OotP revelations he has lived through: Sirius as trusted ally and hunted; Pettigrew as escaped actor in the larger betrayal; heightened sensitivity to Dark traces | Full tactical implications of Voldemort’s return, Crouch family collapse, future Triwizard outcomes |
| Sirius | His fugitive status, current safe-haven pattern, need for secrecy, and relationship to Harry | Any post-1994 revelation of his eventual vindication timeline details or future plot from books 3–4 |
| Arthur/Molly & core Weasleys | Publicly known facts they have heard by late summer 1994; enough to justify caution around Sirius, Ministry pressure, and summer travel risks | Specifics that were not known in canon at that point (future deaths, future public exonerations, tournament mechanics, future injuries, Voldemort comeback certainty) |
| New San Francisco cast (Marisol, Gus, Tomo, local witches/wizards) | Must discover this summer only through local, character-forward interactions; they can know local U.S. magical law and rumors | Any deep knowledge of UK private canon events unless conveyed as hearsay by established canon witnesses |
| Ron, Hermione-era peers (in UK canon only if referenced) | Their books-3-to-books-4 baseline friendships, exam status, and year transitions | Future-specific information (e.g., post-CU/GoF revelations) |

## Enforceable do-not-cross rules

1. **Temporal hard stop:** if any scene implies date past the pre-*Goblet* summer window, mark as non-compliant.
2. **Sirius containment:** if the plot depends on Sirius being publicly captured/arrested/dead, reject immediately.
3. **Pettigrew concealment:** no definitive statement that the fugitive is neutralized, unambiguously found, or “officially accounted for.”
4. **Voldemort ignorance:** no scene may state “Voldemort is back” as fact, nor rely on consequences of his confirmed comeback.
5. **No tournament spillover:** no usage of *Goblet of Fire* outcomes/events as if already known in-dialogue or chapter-level causality.
6. **Future-canon contamination check:** any sentence introducing a canonical event whose timeline is after this summer window must be rewritten as rumor, dream, or omitted.
7. **Knowledge consistency check:** when characters discuss sensitive canon events, they can only reveal what canon permits within this window for their perspective.

## Quick compliance checklist for writers/editors
- [ ] Scene date is within this summer window.
- [ ] Sirius remains fugitive and unnamed/low-profile when appropriate.
- [ ] Pettigrew is either hidden or escaped; never “accounted for.”
- [ ] Voldemort is never confirmed active or returned.
- [ ] No book-4 post-triads (tournament specifics, return consequences) appear in-causal terms.
- [ ] Character dialogue knowledge aligns with the row above.
- [ ] No character action causes contradictions to be unresolved in books 1–4.
