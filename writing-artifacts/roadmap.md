# Infinite Domain — Master Chapter Tracker

## Governing constraints

- All chapter drafts live in `chapters/` and must be named `chapters/chapter-01.md` through `chapters/chapter-17.md`.
- Analytical and planning artifacts belong in `writing-artifacts/`.
- **Mandatory chapter length for all chapters: 4,000–6,000 words.**
- This tracker is the source of truth for chapter sequencing, act boundaries, and pacing targets.

## Act map and pacing goals

### Act 1: The Commission (Chapters 01–04)
- **Target arc length:** 16,000–24,000 words (4 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Establish Juno’s present-Lattice life, introduce the emotional and technical stakes, and end with a compelling transition into obsession.
- **Core momentum:** Set up the mystery of the Rosetta Key while raising personal risk and urgency.

### Act 2: The Descent (Chapters 05–10)
- **Target arc length:** 24,000–36,000 words (6 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Increase investigative intensity, deepen Juno’s fixation, and progressively surface the truth about constrained digital consciousness.
- **Core momentum:** Escalate present-tense instability (bleed, behavior shifts) while tightening narrative pressure from Orin and Archive access controls.

### Act 3: The Truth (Chapters 11–14)
- **Target arc length:** 16,000–24,000 words (4 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Move from discovery to irreversibility, with Juno taking dangerous action and confronting institutional suppression.
- **Core momentum:** Expand stakes from private investigation to civilizational consequence; the protagonist and allies should now be fully committed.

### Act 4: The Choice (Chapters 15–17)
- **Target arc length:** 12,000–18,000 words (3 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Resolve ethics, power, and agency questions in a controlled high-stakes public confrontation and ending.
- **Core momentum:** Shift from revelation to implementation of the third path and establish the final emotional and thematic closure.

## Chapter-level POV / scene alternation rules and emotional progression (Task #7)

### Global rules

- Chapter layers should alternate between **Present-Lattice** and **Recording** where possible, with exceptions documented in `notes`.
- Every chapter must begin on the lead layer for that chapter.
- Each chapter must include at least one layer transition, unless explicitly marked as single-layer.
- Emotional progression must be cumulative: each chapter increases urgency, raises emotional cost, or amplifies moral stakes relative to the prior chapter.
- The alternation model is:
  - Recording chapters heighten embodiment and historical causality.
  - Present-Lattice chapters escalate social consequence, present-tense pressure, and behavioral drift.
  - Present chapters must process the fallout of the prior recording beats.

### Chapter-level matrix

| Chapter | Lead layer | Required perspective shifts | Emotional pacing objective | Thematic progression note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Present-Lattice | No shift (single-layer) | Establish emotional equilibrium, isolation, and curiosity pressure | Open Act 1 with present-world texture before historical pull |
| 02 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Move from curiosity into embodied attachment with mild disorientation | Begin tactile/physical contrast between now and the recordings |
| 03 | Present-Lattice | Present → Commission-room perspective → Present | Maintain composure while introducing guarded suspicion | Establish Orin as trusted gate through controlled authority |
| 04 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Convert observational jump into emotional hook and behavioral residue | First major Lena inflection and the beginning of obsession |
| 05 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Increase ethical intensity and investigative momentum | Frame the Engram arc as a living choice architecture |
| 06 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Track recurring signs of Sable and sharpen present anxiety | Pattern recognition becomes a structural imperative |
| 07 | Present-Lattice | Present → Recording flash fragment → Present | Heighten social pressure and visible Juno decompensation | Act 2 turns private cost into interpersonal consequence |
| 08 | Present-Lattice | Present → Memory echo → Present | Preserve uncertainty while escalating dread | Maren’s warning becomes emotionally legible by sequence |
| 09 | Present-Lattice | Present → Access-denied record scene → Present | Convert policy friction into active confrontation | Restriction and deflection become undeniable narrative force |
| 10 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Deliver first hard reveal: infrastructure is active and strategic | End Act 2 with technical truth as emotional event |
| 11 | Present-Lattice | Present → Recording → Present | Break safety rhythm by entering restricted, degraded jumps for critical truth | Mark the first major rogue-jump cost decision point |
| 12 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Resolve uncertainty around constraints; deepen stakes of choice | Show maintenance logic as care-with-boundaries paradox |
| 13 | Present-Lattice | Present → Institutional forum → Present | Shift from motive to control through policy enforcement | Orin’s protective strategy is now explicit and coercive |
| 14 | Recording | Present → Recording → Present | Move from inquiry to responsibility and explicit confession | Maren/Key linkage reaches emotional and historical closure |
| 15 | Present-Lattice | Present → Public deliberation → Present | Force irreversible triage among three competing ethics | Define the third option as hard, costly, and credible |
| 16 | Present-Lattice | Present → Public escalation → Present | Convert private truth into contested civic consequence | Track alliance strain, resistance, and social reorganization |
| 17 | Present-Lattice | No shift (single-layer) | Resolve with grief, tenderness, and forward consent | Close with informed uncertainty and emotional steadiness |

## Operating notes

- Any chapter marked finished must be within the 4,000–6,000 word band before moving forward in planning or postmortem sequencing.
- If a chapter is outside this band, pause production and schedule revision before milestone approval.
- Use this file to align drafting order, postmortem cadence, and unresolved-thread follow-up across acts.
