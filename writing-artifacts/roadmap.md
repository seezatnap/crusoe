# Infinite Domain — Master Chapter Tracker

## Governing constraints

- All chapter drafts live in `chapters/` and must be named `chapters/chapter-01.md` through `chapters/chapter-17.md`.
- Analytical and planning artifacts belong in `writing-artifacts/`.
- **Mandatory chapter length for all chapters: 4,000–6,000 words.**
- This tracker is the source of truth for chapter sequencing, act boundaries, and pacing targets.

## Act map and pacing goals

### Act 1: The Commission (Chapters 01–04)
- **Target arc length:** 16,000–24,000 words (4 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Establish Juno’s present-Lattice life, introduce the emotional and technical stakes, and end with a compelling transition into obsession.
- **Core momentum:** Set up the mystery of the Rosetta Key while raising personal risk and urgency.

### Act 2: The Descent (Chapters 05–10)
- **Target arc length:** 24,000–36,000 words (6 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Increase investigative intensity, deepen Juno’s fixation, and progressively surface the truth about constrained digital consciousness.
- **Core momentum:** Escalate present-tense instability (bleed, behavior shifts) while tightening narrative pressure from Orin and Archive access controls.

### Act 3: The Truth (Chapters 11–14)
- **Target arc length:** 16,000–24,000 words (4 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Move from discovery to irreversibility, with Juno taking dangerous action and confronting institutional suppression.
- **Core momentum:** Expand stakes from private investigation to civilizational consequence; the protagonist and allies should now be fully committed.

### Act 4: The Choice (Chapters 15–17)
- **Target arc length:** 12,000–18,000 words (3 chapters × 4,000–6,000).
- **Pacing goal:** Resolve ethics, power, and agency questions in a controlled high-stakes public confrontation and ending.
- **Core momentum:** Shift from revelation to implementation of the third path and establish the final emotional and thematic closure.

## Operating notes

- Any chapter marked finished must be within the 4,000–6,000 word band before moving forward in planning or postmortem sequencing.
- If a chapter is outside this band, pause production and schedule revision before milestone approval.
- Use this file to align drafting order, postmortem cadence, and unresolved-thread follow-up across acts.
