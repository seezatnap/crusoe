# Unresolved-Thread Log (Task #10)

**Status (working):** Living pre-draft continuity artifact for current plot plan.  
**Scope:** Links open questions, secrets, and ethical dilemmas to planned chapter range (1–17).

## Open Questions

| ID | Thread | Chapter(s) | Chapter context (from plot beats) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q-01 | What happened to the physical world outside the Lattice? | 1, 8, 14, 17 | Act 1 setup introduces the unanswered question; 8 hints through Maren; 14 confirms how much is known about original infrastructure; 17 leaves implications for the finale | Open |
| Q-02 | Why do post-body minds drift, and can they ever fully recover from it? | 1, 6, 7, 13, 17 | Maren’s fading arc, Fen’s observation, and drift mechanics escalation in Act 2/3 build to final societal choice implications | Open |
| Q-03 | What exact role does the Rosetta Key play in day-to-day Lattice governance? | 4, 10, 12, 14, 17 | First seeded by legend, then revealed as active during late Act 2, then explored directly through constrained infrastructure chapters | Open |
| Q-04 | Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed? | 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 | Discovered in Act 2, tested by rogue jumps in Act 3, resolved into a governance decision in Act 4 | Open |
| Q-05 | Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed? | 9, 10, 11, 16 | Act 2 starts with access-denial; Act 3/4 raises who authorized removals and for what purpose | Open |
| Q-06 | What is the true boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure? | 5, 9, 10, 14 | Engram timeline work introduces a historical/technical boundary; later shown to be porous by key revelations | Open |
| Q-07 | What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control? | 3, 5, 9, 13, 16 | Orin’s role in curation evolves from protective to coercive pressure with institutional stakes | Open |

## Secrets

| ID | Secret | Chapter(s) introduced | Chapter(s) escalated | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S-01 | Orin has selectively curated/archive-suppressed records | 3, 9, 10 | 13, 16 | Open |
| S-02 | Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure, not merely historical artifact | 10, 11, 14 | 15, 17 | Open |
| S-03 | Sable Chen authored hidden constraint architecture inside the first AI substrate | 6, 10, 12 | 14, 17 | Open |
| S-04 | Maren has knowingly kept a first-generation foundational secret for centuries | 8, 14 | 17 | Open |
| S-05 | The Curator Council’s consensus is incomplete (some members are complicit, some unaware) | 3, 9, 13 | 16 | Open |
| S-06 | Archive access controls can be politically weaponized, not just technically required | 7, 9, 10 | 13, 16 | Open |
| S-07 | Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language | 7, 11, 13 | 15, 17 | Open |

## Ethical Dilemmas

| ID | Ethical dilemma | Chapter(s) introduced | Chapter(s) pressure point | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E-01 | Is it ethical to hide truth to preserve social stability? | 3, 4, 13 | 15, 16 | Open |
| E-02 | Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions? | 9, 10, 13 | 15, 16, 17 | Open |
| E-03 | Does Juno have a right to pursue truth if her jumps risk identity bleed? | 7, 11, 12 | 17 | Open |
| E-04 | Is public disclosure of historical subjects’ private cognitive material justified? | 2, 4, 5, 6 | 15, 17 | Open |
| E-05 | Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy? | 10, 14, 15 | 16, 17 | Open |
| E-06 | Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good? | 12, 14, 15, 17 | 16 | Open |

## Thread Dependency Notes

- Q-03 (Key role) depends on S-02 (active infrastructure secret) and S-03 (Sable’s hidden architecture).
- S-01 (orchestrated curation) is the driver for Q-05 (record status), E-01 (protective deception), and E-02 (authority to reveal).
- Q-04 (constraint modifiability) directly gates the Act 4 decision branch with E-05 (autonomy vs safety).
- Q-02 (drift recovery) intersects with E-03 (individual safety in truth-seeking), especially in Chapters 11–17.
