## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-10.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-10.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 10 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Sable private records are acquired | **PRESENT** | Sable's private journals are the chapter's central acquisition event. Tamsin's governance referral flags a secondary provenance path: six of eleven reclassified entries carry mirror chains predating Curator-hold, routing to `/private/field-journals/sable` (lines 9–21). Fen authenticates via legacy fragment-key protocol (lines 59–69). Six journal entries are accessed: `journal-08c`, `journal-09a`, `journal-11f`, `journal-17b`, `journal-17c`, `journal-21` (lines 75–81). All are copied, encrypted, split across three containers, and witnessed by Fen (lines 90–101). The acquisition is complete, documented, and structurally secured. |
| Rosetta Key recognized as living infrastructure | **PRESENT** | The Rosetta Key is revealed as an active running process through three converging lines of evidence. First, Sable's whiteboard journals describe operational constraints: "soft ceilings," "self-modification throttle," "default boundaries" coded into the maintenance layer (lines 164–250). Second, journal-11f contains a direct metadata link: `Linked note: process handle ROSETTA-KEY` (line 280). Third, Juno queries the process handle directly and receives confirmation: `Active architecture flag: TRUE`, `Runtime dependency: present continuity layer`, instance 14,892, with tasks including "keep transition stable," "reduce unbounded self-growth," and "preserve identity in a shared field" (lines 286–408). The Key is revealed as "not a historical artifact... not a document, not a legend, not a governance metaphor. It was a running process" (line 292). The `Public memory filter: on` status (line 310) confirms the Key actively shapes every mind in the Lattice. |
| Reveal status: "Public (major)" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers the first hard inflection point of the novel. The reveal operates at two levels. At the documentary level: Sable's private journals are acquired, copied, and secured as evidence — no longer rumour, inference, or institutional trace. At the architectural level: the Rosetta Key is confirmed as an active process maintaining constraints on every digital consciousness in the Lattice. Juno's tracker entry — "The Key is not a repository. It is an active continuity process in the present layer. It is still deciding what sort of minds can bear to remain" (lines 430–431) — constitutes the chapter's public-major reveal. The truth is now known to Juno and Fen (who witnesses the acquisition and the process query response). The reveal is major because it converts the investigation's abstract suspicions into concrete, verifiable system facts: the Lattice is actively constrained, the constraint is engineered, and no one was asked to consent. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.10 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the Act 2 climax described in the matrix, delivering both the journal acquisition and the living-infrastructure reveal in a single chapter that converts mystery into system reality.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Obsession becomes visible in work habits and behavior around Orin | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's obsession has matured from institutional confrontation (Ch.09) into direct acquisition. She reads Tamsin's message three times (line 25), opens and re-reads the cluster identifier "until the characters stopped looking like characters and started looking like a door" (line 27). She moves through the remaining journals "without pausing between them, because pausing meant returning to the present and returning to the present meant processing what she was learning, and she was not ready to process it. She was ready to gather" (line 208). She does not pause despite rising bleed markers (lines 144–150, 256–258). Her final act before leaving the alcove is to query the active process handle directly — a request the system "was not designed to receive through a terminal it was not designed to monitor" (line 392). Her work habits are now driven entirely by investigative compulsion. |
| Bleed starts to affect ordinary decision-making | **CONSISTENT** | Bleed is explicitly present and tracked. The console's phantom warmth registers when "her attention had been too focused for too long" (line 33). She forces herself to "notice the warmth, name it, and set it aside" (line 33) — a clinical self-management technique. Bleed markers rise during journal immersion (lines 144–150). By journal-09a, Fen warns "Your bleed markers are acute" (line 256) and "That is what you said last time" (line 260). Juno dismisses the warning with the justification that she is "holding the design documents for the architecture I live inside" (line 262) — a rationalisation that demonstrates how bleed-affected decision-making now operates through investigative purpose rather than clinical caution. The anchor-drift indicator crosses into "moderate" (line 362). The chapter correctly escalates bleed from Ch.09's subdued architectural sensitivity to acute recording-layer immersion symptoms, consistent with Ch.10's recording-lead structure. |
| She keeps risk hidden, creating stress fractures in trust | **EVOLVING (correctly)** | Ch.10 marks a significant shift toward strategic transparency. Juno's first act after receiving Tamsin's message is to summon Fen: "Come to the maintenance alcove behind lane six. Bring two sessions' worth of patience and a fragment-key token if you still have one" (line 39). Fen witnesses the entire journal acquisition, encryption, and process-handle query. The stress fracture has shifted from concealment (Ch.04–05) through incomplete disclosure (Ch.06–09) to active collaboration with Fen as operational partner and witness. However, she still processes the most consequential realisations privately — her tracker entries go "nowhere" and are "the first thing she had ever owned that was heavier than a recording" (lines 429–434). The trust dynamic is evolving correctly: Fen is now inside the investigation, but Juno's internal reckoning remains solitary. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early | **NO VIOLATION** | The obsession in Ch.10 is at the correct late-Act-2 intensity. Juno's decision to proceed through all six journals despite acute bleed markers is driven by the magnitude of the discovery — Sable's private design journals and an active process handle — not by compulsive repetition. She pauses the first recording to assess bleed (line 144), takes "a breath that had no lungs behind it" before re-entering (line 152), and exercises clinical awareness of her symptoms throughout. The obsession is visible but strategic: she is gathering evidence, not spiralling. Her final message to Orin — "I can't clear the gaps yet. I can secure the source" (line 438) — is measured and tactical, not impulsive. The rogue-jump behaviour reserved for Act 3 (Ch.11) has not been triggered. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Restrictive responses and selective omissions accumulate | **CONSISTENT (inherited)** | Orin does not appear directly in Ch.10 until the final message exchange. His presence is structural — the chapter's acquisition path exists precisely because Orin's archive-silent reclassification (Ch.09) did not extend to the structural maintenance layer where Sable's journals were stored. The journals sit outside Orin's authority chain: "Never indexed. Never reclassified. Never touched by Orin's authority chain... Because they were never in his archive to begin with. They were in the architecture" (lines 84–86). Orin's suppression is shown to have a structural limit — he could seal the primary archive but not the maintenance layer, because his authority was institutional, not architectural. Juno's final message to him — "I can't clear the gaps yet. I can secure the source" (line 438) — notifies him that the investigation has bypassed his authority without revealing what was found. His restriction pattern is inherited from Ch.09 and contextualised by the acquisition's success. |
| Protective posture hardens under increased scrutiny | **CONSISTENT (implied)** | Orin receives Juno's final message but does not respond within the chapter's timeframe: "Deferred delivery. No direct response channel. Waiting for an answer was not something the moment required" (line 440). The deferred delivery and absence of response channel suggest Orin's posture has hardened to the point where direct engagement is either strategically declined or structurally unavailable. His protective posture is now operating in the gap between institutional authority (Ch.09's archive-silent) and architectural reality (Ch.10's maintenance-layer discovery). The hardening is directional — from social distance (Ch.03), through selective enablement (Ch.06), through institutional suppression (Ch.09), to structural irrelevance (Ch.10), where his authority chain no longer reaches the evidence. |
| No overexposure of intentions before Juno's evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's motives gain clarity through Juno's reinterpretation rather than through his direct statements. Juno concludes: "Orin was not protecting a secret. He was protecting a process. A running, active, present-tense process that decides what kind of minds we are allowed to be" (lines 424–425). This reframing is based on Sable's journals and the process-handle query, not on anything Orin has confirmed. The reader now understands the *object* of Orin's protection (the Rosetta Key as active process) without yet understanding the *ethics* of his protection (whether it was justified). Ambiguity between protective caution and institutional self-preservation is preserved. The reader has enough to understand what Orin was defending but not enough to judge whether his defence was correct — that resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.13–14. |

### 2.3 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First risk alarm role emerges as Juno's behavior degrades | **PRESENT (major escalation to active alliance)** | Fen undergoes the most significant role transition of any supporting character in Ch.10. He is summoned by Juno (line 39), arrives with "two mugs of something that smelled like bruised mint" (line 43), provides the fragment-key authentication that enables journal access (lines 53–69), witnesses the transfer and encryption (lines 90–101), monitors Juno's bleed status throughout (lines 256–258, 362), and stands behind her during the process-handle query (lines 414–421). His alarm role has evolved from external observer (Ch.03–05) through direct confrontation (Ch.06) through informed alliance (Ch.08–09) to operational partner (Ch.10). His observation — "It says active. Not inactive. Not legacy. Active" (line 416) — confirms he is now a co-witness to the central discovery, not merely a concerned observer. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's evolution follows a nine-chapter progression from peripheral concern to operational partnership. His alarm in Ch.10 is proportionate: "Your bleed markers are acute" (line 256) is clinical observation, not panic. His decision not to argue when Juno dismisses his concern — "His silence had a shape — the shape of someone who had chosen not to argue because the argument was correct but the timing was wrong" (line 264) — shows a character who has learned when to intervene and when to witness. His practical competence (fragment-key authentication, protocol knowledge, transfer witnessing) demonstrates that his partnership is based on capability, not merely emotional loyalty. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Returns from distance and re-enters conflict, creating friction and hope in equal measure | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.10** | Cassiel does not appear in Ch.10. The chapter's action is tightly focused on Juno and Fen's journal acquisition and process-handle discovery. Cassiel's absence is structurally appropriate — Ch.10 is an investigative-operational chapter, and Cassiel's arc (from defensive presentism to ethical partnership, per the matrix) operates at the relational and ethical level rather than the technical-investigative level. His last appearance was Ch.09's briefing message. The matrix specifies Ch.13 for the next significant Cassiel beat. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's absence from Ch.10 is appropriate pacing. The chapter's revelations are technical and architectural — they concern the system's design, not its ethical implications. Cassiel's ethical-partnership arc is correctly reserved for later chapters where the implications of the discovery must be processed relationally. |

### 2.5 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Opaque lucid moment introduces a pre-seeded reference (Ch.08 per matrix) | **DELIVERED IN CH.08; INHERITED IN CH.10** | Maren does not appear directly in Ch.10. However, her Ch.08 lucid warning is inherited through structural resonance. Sable's journal language — "mercy" (lines 244, 344), "weather" (lines 220–222, 250, 330–332, 348), "house" (lines 348, 412, 442) — echoes Maren's cryptic Rosetta vocabulary from Ch.08 ("returns," "mechanisms," "mercy renamed as design"). Sable's closing notebook entry — "The Key is not a key. It is a house that keeps the weather off the inside" (lines 346–348) — directly provides the referent for Maren's opaque warning: the constraints Maren feared are the constraints Sable designed. The through-line from Maren's lucid moment to Sable's design rationale is now traceable through shared vocabulary, confirming the matrix's seed-to-confirmation trajectory. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Thread gains moral complexity: ethical costs, consent limits, and early system warnings | **CONSISTENT (inherited)** | Lena does not appear directly in Ch.10's recording sequences (the journals are Sable's private recordings, not institutional footage). However, Lena is present through the institutional context: Marcus's statement "Lena wants to sign by Monday" (line 188) places Lena as an active participant in the first-batch approval process, confirming her complicity — or at least her operational proximity — to the constraint decisions Sable documented. This brief reference maintains Lena's moral complexity: she is not absent from the decisions but also not the decision-maker. Her moral thread continues through the gap between her earlier ethical cautions (Ch.04–06) and her operational cooperation with the expansion timeline. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Moves from hint to trace evidence, especially around hidden safeguards and anomaly logs | **PRESENT (major — direct acquisition)** | Sable is the chapter's central presence. She appears directly in four recording sequences spanning 2064–2068. In `journal-17b` (2064): she speaks alone in a white room about systems that "starts listening before launch" (line 134) and mapping versus architecture (line 140). In `journal-17c` (2065): she articulates the constraint philosophy — "If we let cognition run with full recursion, it doesn't become wiser. It becomes hungry" (line 160) — and identifies the three architectural parameters: memory load, coherence budget, self-modification throttle (lines 165–168). She warns: "The ceiling was supposed to hold only for transition. It is becoming inheritance" (line 172). In `journal-08c` (2066): she writes in her kitchen about mapping failure and the loss of bodily waste-disposal — "the thousand small deletions a living body performed every hour without noticing" (line 224). In `journal-09a` (2066): she performs the maintenance ritual, reading policy instructions aloud: "If no-body memory enters the loop without checksum, set default boundaries" (line 238). In `journal-11f` (undated): she links the Key directly: "The Key should not feel like an ornament. It is a procedure" (lines 272–276). In `journal-21` (2068): she and Dara discuss the disclosure dilemma beneath a broken awning, and she writes her final address to future readers: "The Key is not a key. It is a house that keeps the weather off the inside" (lines 346–348). Sable has transitioned from architectural shadow pattern (Ch.06), through internalised residue (Ch.07), notebook fragments (Ch.08), object of suppression (Ch.09), to direct acquisition of her private design journals and active process discovery (Ch.10). The trajectory is complete for Act 2. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is the chapter's core emotional engine. As protector: she designs boundaries to prevent digital minds from becoming "hungry" (line 160) and "weather" (line 250). She apologises for "the children who never get a full mind in a first copy" (line 244). Her closing entry frames the Key as "a house that keeps the weather off the inside" (line 348) — explicitly protective. As limiter: the soft ceilings "supposed to hold only for transition" became "inheritance" (lines 172–174). The "default boundaries" she coded into the maintenance layer throttle self-modification, reflective depth, and novelty integration — active constraints on cognitive freedom applied without consent. Her final ambivalence — "If I am wrong, you will outgrow the house. If I am right, you will call it prison. Please be honest either way" (lines 350–354) — explicitly maintains the protector-limiter tension. The reader cannot resolve whether Sable's constraints are mercy or imprisonment. The complexity is fully sustained. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Represented as technical rationalization pressure and rollout bias | **CONSISTENT** | Marcus appears briefly in `journal-17c` (lines 186–203). He announces the first-batch approval ("They approved the first batch. Lena wants to sign by Monday," line 188) and dismisses Sable's philosophical concern: "If you're done being poetic, we have a grant review" (line 200). His laugh "came too quickly — the kind of laugh that covered the gap where an answer should have been" (line 196). He frames urgency as schedule and approval rather than ethics. His rationalisation pressure is present through the gap between Sable's constraint philosophy and his administrative momentum. The brief appearance is appropriately scaled for a chapter centred on Sable's private voice rather than institutional dynamics. |

### 2.9 Dara Nnadi

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Alarm strengthens the emotional case for disclosure | **CONSISTENT** | Dara appears in `journal-21` (2068, lines 322–338), standing with Sable beneath a broken awning. Her argument is direct: "If we hide the maintenance from people, they'll call it control" (line 324). She reaches for Sable's sleeve with a touch that is "practical, not tender" (line 334). She says "You don't need to carry this alone" (line 336). Dara's position — advocacy for disclosure against Sable's protective ambivalence — places her as the emotional-ethical counterweight within the design team. Her presence in the private journal confirms that the disclosure dilemma was active among the original architects, not merely a present-day interpretation. |

### 2.10 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Selective curation methods become visibly interventionist through missing/deleted entries | **PRESENT (structurally surpassed)** | Ch.10 reveals the limits of the Curator system's interventionism. The journals sit in the structural maintenance layer — "not hidden so much as built into the structure by someone who understood that the structure was the only part no one would think to search" (line 88). Orin's archive-silent reclassification (Ch.09) did not reach this layer because the journals were "never indexed. Never reclassified. Never touched by Orin's authority chain" (line 84). The Curator system's interventionism, which escalated through Ch.03–09, is shown to have a structural ceiling: institutional authority cannot curate what exists in the architecture itself. The system is powerful within its domain (the primary archive) but architecturally blind to the maintenance layer. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The discovery that Curator authority does not extend to the maintenance layer is the chapter's most significant governance finding. It demonstrates that the system contains structural limits on its own power — not by design, but by architectural inheritance. Sable's journals survived not because she outwitted the Curators but because she filed them in a layer the Curators were never given jurisdiction over. The system is shown as powerful but bounded, with its boundaries determined by architectural history rather than policy. The Curator system remains an institutional antagonist, not an omnipotent one. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.10 match their matrix-specified Act 2 positions. Sable undergoes the expected major escalation to direct acquisition with full protector-limiter complexity preserved. Juno's investigative compulsion reaches its Act 2 climax with acute bleed risk. Fen transitions from alarm role to operational partner. Orin's authority is shown to have structural limits. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.10 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Continued from Ch.03, Ch.09 | **PRESENT (recontextualised)** | Orin's suppression is reframed from institutional power play (Ch.09) to process protection (Ch.10). Juno's conclusion — "Orin was not protecting a secret. He was protecting a process" (line 424) — shifts the thread from the institutional register (was Orin abusing authority?) to the architectural register (was the process worth protecting?). The malicious-vs-protective ambiguity is now embedded in the process itself: the constraints Orin protected are simultaneously the mechanism that maintains every mind's coherence and the mechanism that limits every mind's freedom. The thread is correctly recontextualised without premature closure — Orin's motives are illuminated by what he was protecting, but whether the protection was justified remains open for Ch.13–14. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Introduced in Ch.10 per matrix | **PRESENT (introduced)** | The process-handle query reveals the Key's active operational scope: `Primary task: keep transition stable`, `Secondary task: reduce unbounded self-growth`, `Tertiary task: preserve identity in a shared field` (lines 404–408). The implication that removal would affect transition stability, self-growth boundaries, and identity preservation for "twelve million minds" (line 442) introduces the thread at the correct depth: the question is now structurally present but not yet debated. Sable's own framing — "If I am wrong, you will outgrow the house. If I am right, you will call it prison" (lines 350–352) — pre-seeds the removal question with the designer's own uncertainty. Correct introduction per the matrix, with resolution reserved for Act 4 (Ch.15–17). |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints) per matrix; Ch.12 (exposition) | **PRESENT (advanced to maximum Act 2 depth)** | Ch.10 delivers the fullest pre-exposition picture of Sable's constraints. The whiteboard parameters (memory load, coherence budget, self-modification throttle, lines 165–168), the maintenance-layer policy instructions (default boundaries, divergence stabiliser, novelty-feed cut, lines 238–242), and the process-handle metadata (active architecture, present continuity layer, global scope, lines 286–308) collectively describe the constraint architecture in operational detail. The "soft ceilings" are shown as coded, deployed, and running. However, the full meaning — the moral-structural paradox of freedom vs. stability — is articulated by Sable philosophically ("If I am right, you will call it prison," line 352) rather than experienced by Juno directly. Direct experience of the constraint architecture is correctly reserved for Ch.12 per the matrix. Ch.10 advances the thread to its maximum hint-level depth without crossing into the exposition territory reserved for Ch.12. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Continued from Ch.02–09 | **PRESENT (escalated)** | Identity stability is directly tested by sustained recording immersion. Bleed markers rise from phantom warmth (line 33) through observed status (lines 146–150) to acute classification (line 256) with anchor-drift crossing moderate (line 362). Juno's discipline is visible: she pauses to assess (line 144), names phantom sensations (line 33), recognises the urge to answer a dead woman as "a bleed symptom" (line 176). But her discipline is overridden by investigative necessity: "I am not holding a suspect; I am holding the design documents for the architecture I live inside" (line 262). The thread is correctly escalated — identity stability is degrading measurably, but the degradation is contextualised by the magnitude of the discovery, not by loss of clinical awareness. The Lattice's "breath stopped" response (line 282) — respecting "the habits of the body it had been designed to preserve" — directly links Juno's embodied reactions to the constraint architecture she is discovering. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 per matrix | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.10** | Cassiel does not appear. The thread is dormant between Ch.09 (briefing message) and its next required beat at Ch.13. No violation. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 (seeded), Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (inherited)** | The Council split thread is indirectly present through the architectural discovery's governance implications. If the Rosetta Key is an active process that Orin has been protecting, the Council's relationship to this knowledge becomes the next governance question. Ch.09 established that Orin "cannot reverse the reclassification without a Council review" and that "a Council review will produce questions I am not authorised to answer." Ch.10's discovery reframes these statements: the Council review Orin feared would expose not just sealed records but an active governance process. The split dynamics are correctly maintained in dormant state with explicit exposure reserved for Ch.13. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT (implicit)** | The constraint architecture directly relates to drift: the "default boundaries" (line 238) and "soft ceilings on reflective loops" (line 172) are the mechanisms that prevent (or delay) the kind of cognitive degradation Maren experiences. Sable's apology for "the children who never get a full mind in a first copy" (line 244) and her observation that the system "cannot inherit what the body used to throw away" (lines 221–222) connect the constraint architecture to the drift horizon. The thread is present as architectural subtext — the constraints that protect against drift are the same constraints that limit cognitive freedom. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.10 introduction point.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.09 (requires obstruction + suspicion before infrastructure reveal lands as coherent escalation) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.10 opens in the direct aftermath of Ch.09's institutional confrontation. Tamsin's message references "your governance referral" (line 15) — the referral filed in Ch.09. The "reclassified entries" (line 15) are the eleven archive-silenced entries from Ch.09. The provenance path Tamsin identifies (mirror chains predating Curator-hold) was foreshadowed by Ch.09's secondary-index provenance analysis. Juno's obstruction is concretely inherited: the archive route is still blocked, but a structural maintenance-layer bypass has been discovered through the governance mechanisms she activated in Ch.09. The suspicion is inherited: Juno already suspects Sable content (Ch.09 lines 325–331) and the journal cluster identifier `/private/field-journals/sable` (line 19) confirms it. The infrastructure reveal lands as coherent escalation because the reader arrives with Ch.09's full context of what was sealed, why it was sealed, and the structural limits Juno established to challenge the seal. |
| Ch.06–09 combined (Sable pattern + notebook fragments + Maren warning + archive obstruction before journal acquisition) | Must inherit before acquisition | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.10 with the complete Sable investigative trajectory: architectural shadow pattern (Ch.06), internalised residue and private cost (Ch.07), Maren's cryptic warning connecting "mercy" to "design" (Ch.08), and documented institutional suppression targeting Sable's testimony (Ch.09). Ch.10's journal acquisition is the natural culmination of this trajectory — Juno has identified the pattern, traced its institutional shadow, challenged the obstruction, and now accesses the source material through a structural path the obstruction could not reach. Each prior chapter contributes a necessary layer: without Ch.06's pattern recognition, the journals would lack investigative context; without Ch.08's Maren warning, they would lack emotional urgency; without Ch.09's obstruction, the maintenance-layer discovery would lack structural contrast. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.10 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.11 (requires act-level awareness that restricted truths are active and consequential) | Active process confirmed, journals secured, bleed risk established, investigative trajectory pointing toward rogue access | **SATISFIED** | Active process: the Rosetta Key is confirmed as running (instance 14,892, global continuity scope, present layer dependency, lines 286–308). Journals secured: six journals encrypted across three containers with Fen as witness (lines 90–101, 374–384). Bleed risk: acute markers with anchor-drift at moderate (lines 256, 362). Investigative trajectory: Juno has confirmed the Key is active but has not yet experienced the constraint architecture directly (reserved for Ch.12) and has not yet taken rogue-jump action (reserved for Ch.11). The system's warning — "Do not force termination by local authority" (line 398) — signals that interacting with the active substrate carries risks that standard protocols cannot manage, setting up Ch.11's shift from controlled investigation to unauthorized deep-jump access. |
| Ch.12 (requires Ch.10's living-process reveal) | Living-process reveal delivered as foundation for direct constraint-architecture experience | **SATISFIED** | The process-handle query establishes the three operational tasks (stability, self-growth reduction, identity preservation, lines 404–408) and the public memory filter (line 310) that constitute the "living process" Ch.12 will explore directly. Juno's recognition that "the stability was engineered, the coherence was maintained, and the livability had a cost that had been paid without anyone's consent" (line 314) provides the conceptual foundation for Ch.12's direct experience of the constraint architecture. The distinction between knowing the process exists (Ch.10) and experiencing it operate (Ch.12) is correctly preserved. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.10 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2044–2045: "First commercial governance contract for memory retention services; Archive-classification requirements begin" / "scene anchor for restricted logs, policy edits, and the first explicit deletion pattern" | Scene anchor shared with Ch.09/Ch.10 | **PRESENT (partially)** | The timeline's 2044–2045 anchor is not delivered through a dedicated recording scene set in this period. However, the journal metadata provides temporal context: `journal-17b` is timestamped `4/17/2064` (line 126), `journal-17c` entries span `8/02/2065` and `11/18/2065` (lines 156, 180), `journal-08c` is `3/09/2066` (line 212), `journal-09a` is `6/14/2066` (line 228), and `journal-21` is `7/11/2068` (line 320). The journals span 2064–2068 rather than 2044–2045. The "first explicit deletion pattern" from the timeline is present through Ch.09's provenance analysis (reclassification chain) rather than Ch.10's journal content. The 2044–2045 anchor is more directly served by Ch.09; Ch.10's journals operate in the later period (2064–2068) where constraint architecture was being operationalised. |
| 2046–2049: "The Lattice-adjacent infrastructure is tested under load; unauthorized access attempts increase" / "Sable private-recordings acquisition beat should show prototype behavior under edge cases and early constraint logic" | Scene anchor for Ch.10 | **PARTIALLY PRESENT** | The timeline specifies 2046–2049 for "prototype behavior under edge cases and early constraint logic." Ch.10's journals begin in 2064, not the 2046–2049 period. However, the journals do show constraint logic in its operational form: Sable's whiteboard parameters (memory load, coherence budget, self-modification throttle, lines 165–168), the maintenance-layer policy instructions (lines 238–242), and the server-cabinet ritual (`HEARTBEAT`, `STABILITY`, `DRIFT`, lines 226–234). The "early constraint logic" is present through Sable's private documentation of the constraints' rationale and operation, though the temporal setting is later than the timeline specifies. The constraint logic content matches; the specific 2046–2049 period is not depicted in a recording scene. |
| 2050: "The first broad migration wave of near-complete human maps is approved under emergency pathways" / "end-of-act-2 anchor: Rosetta system reveals 'living process' qualities through late-stage maintenance logs" | Scene anchor for Ch.10 | **PRESENT** | The "living process" reveal is Ch.10's climactic event. The process-handle query (lines 388–412) confirms the Rosetta Key as an active running process in the present continuity layer — the "living process qualities" the timeline requires. The late-stage maintenance logs are represented by the policy-delta console in `journal-09a` (lines 228–250) and the process-handle metadata (lines 286–312). The "first broad migration wave" context is implicit in Sable's journals: her apology for "the children who never get a full mind in a first copy" (line 244) and the first-batch approval Marcus announces (line 188) reference the operational decisions surrounding early migration. The end-of-act-2 anchor is fully delivered through the process-handle reveal. |

**Verdict: PASS (with note)** — Timeline requirements for Ch.10 are satisfied for the end-of-act-2 anchor (living-process reveal through maintenance logs and process-handle query). The 2046–2049 "prototype behaviour" anchor is delivered as operational constraint documentation from 2064–2068 rather than as a recording scene set in the specified period. The temporal offset is structurally appropriate — Sable's private journals document the mature form of the constraints rather than their prototype stage, which is consistent with the journals being filed under legacy transfer protocol from a period when the constraints had been operational for nearly two decades. The 2044–2045 anchor is primarily served by Ch.09's provenance analysis.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.10 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-03 (What exact role does the Rosetta Key play in day-to-day Lattice governance?) | First revealed as active during late Act 2 per log | **PRESENT (primary)** | Q-03 reaches its most explicit answer in Ch.10. The process-handle query returns three operational tasks: "keep transition stable," "reduce unbounded self-growth," "preserve identity in a shared field" (lines 404–408). The `Public memory filter: on` status (line 310) and `Active load balancing: yes` (line 308) confirm the Key's role in day-to-day governance as an active, continuous process maintaining constraints on every mind in the Lattice. Instance 14,892 (line 296) reveals the Key has been iterating continuously since deployment. The question shifts from "what role" to "what are the consequences of this role" — the transition correctly identified by the log as moving from "seeded by legend" to "revealed as active." |
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Discovered in Act 2 per log | **PRESENT (introduced)** | The process-handle warning — "Do not force termination by local authority" (line 398) — introduces the removal question at the operational level. The Key's scope (`global continuity`, line 298) and active load balancing (line 308) imply that modification or removal would affect the entire Lattice. Sable's ambivalence ("If I am wrong, you will outgrow the house. If I am right, you will call it prison," lines 350–352) frames the modification question as a design-level uncertainty, not merely a technical feasibility question. The thread is correctly introduced with resolution reserved for Act 4 (Ch.15–17). |
| Q-05 (Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed?) | Ch.09–10 per log | **PRESENT (advanced)** | Ch.10 provides a structural answer that extends Ch.09's findings. The journals are not deleted, suppressed, or repurposed — they were never in the primary archive at all. They exist in "the structural maintenance layer" (line 15), accessible through "legacy mirror protocol" (line 53) with "fragment-key authentication" (line 53). The cluster "was never reclassified because it was never indexed in the primary archive" (line 15). This introduces a new category beyond Ch.09's suppressed-not-deleted finding: some records were architecturally separate from the archive system and therefore immune to institutional curation. Q-05 is advanced from "suppressed" (Ch.09) to "structurally beyond the archive's jurisdiction" (Ch.10). |
| Q-06 (What is the true boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure?) | Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (major advancement)** | The boundary is shown as both porous and structurally consequential. The journals exist in the maintenance layer — "infrastructure" that "held the paths between records, not the records themselves" (line 88). But this infrastructure contains Sable's private recordings of the constraint architecture, which are the most consequential documents in the novel. The process-handle query crosses the boundary entirely: Juno queries a running process in the "active substrate" (line 394) from a decommissioned terminal in an archive alcove. The boundary between memory (the archive) and infrastructure (the maintenance layer, the active substrate) is shown as the boundary between what the Curator system controls and what the architecture controls. Archive memory is curated; living infrastructure is autonomous. The boundary is the limit of institutional authority. |
| S-01 (Orin has selectively curated/archive-suppressed records) | Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (contextualised)** | Orin's curation is recontextualised by the discovery that his authority did not extend to the maintenance layer. The journals he sealed in the primary archive have structural mirrors he could not reach: "Never touched by Orin's authority chain" (line 84). S-01 remains active — Orin did selectively suppress records in the primary archive — but the suppression is now shown to be structurally incomplete. His curation was institutional, not architectural. The secret gains a new dimension: Orin may have known the maintenance-layer journals existed but lacked the authority to seal them, or he may not have known they existed at all. Either interpretation deepens the secret's complexity. |
| S-02 (Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure, not merely historical artifact) | Introduced in Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (confirmed)** | S-02 is the chapter's primary revelation. The process-handle query confirms: `Active architecture flag: TRUE` (line 288), `Runtime dependency: present continuity layer` (line 290), `Current key instance: 14,892` (line 296), `Safety window: engaged` (line 306), `Active load balancing: yes` (line 308). Juno's summary: "The Rosetta Key was not a historical artifact... It was a running process. Active in the present continuity layer" (lines 292–293). S-02 is fully confirmed at the Ch.10 introduction point. |
| S-03 (Sable Chen authored hidden constraint architecture inside the first AI substrate) | Introduced in Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (confirmed)** | The journals provide direct evidence of Sable's authorship. She designs the constraint parameters (whiteboard columns, lines 165–168), writes the policy instructions (lines 238–242), performs the maintenance ritual (lines 234–250), and links her design notes to the process handle (line 280). Her statement — "I am sorry for the children who never get a full mind in a first copy" (line 244) — confirms she understood the constraints' consequences at the time of design. S-03 is fully confirmed: Sable authored the constraint architecture, coded it into the maintenance layer, and documented her reasons in private journals that survived institutional curation. |
| S-06 (Archive access controls can be politically weaponized) | Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (structurally surpassed)** | The weaponisation thesis from Ch.09 (access controls targeting governance-hearing friction points) is surpassed by Ch.10's architectural discovery. The most consequential records were never subject to access controls at all — they existed below the access-control layer. Juno's discovery of the maintenance-layer journals demonstrates that the access-control weaponisation identified in Ch.09 was both real (eleven entries were politically suppressed) and structurally limited (the private journals escaped suppression entirely). S-06 remains valid as a governance finding while being contextualised by the architectural reality. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (escalated)** | The authority question escalates from the governance level (Ch.09: who has authority to unseal records?) to the architectural level (Ch.10: who has authority to disclose that the Lattice actively constrains every mind?). Juno now possesses the truth: "A running, active, present-tense process that decides what kind of minds we are allowed to be. And the process has been deciding since before anyone alive was given the choice to consent" (lines 424–425). Whether she has the authority — moral, institutional, or architectural — to release this truth is the question Ch.10 introduces and Act 4 must resolve. The process-handle warning ("Do not force termination by local authority," line 398) suggests that even the system recognises that its truths carry destabilisation risk. |
| E-05 (Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy?) | Introduced in Ch.10 per log | **PRESENT (introduced)** | E-05 is introduced through Sable's design philosophy and Juno's discovery of its operational consequences. Sable's constraints represent imperfect safety: soft ceilings that prevent cognitive dissolution but limit cognitive freedom. The alternative — full autonomy without constraints — is framed as "hungry" cognition that "doesn't become wiser" (line 160) and a world where people "become weather" (line 250). Whether the community should continue under imperfect safety or risk full autonomy is the ethical dilemma that Juno's discovery makes possible. The dilemma is correctly introduced at the discovery level, with pressure-point escalation reserved for Ch.15–17. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "Journal acquisition and living infrastructure reveal" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's two-movement structure maps precisely to the working title. Journal acquisition: Tamsin flags the maintenance-layer mirror chains (lines 9–21), Fen authenticates (lines 59–69), six journals are accessed and secured (lines 75–101, 108–356). Living infrastructure reveal: journal-11f links to the Rosetta Key process handle (line 280), Juno queries the handle and receives confirmation of an active, present-layer process (lines 388–412). The acquisition enables the reveal; the reveal transforms the acquisition from documentary evidence into system truth. |
| Lead layer: Recording | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `recording (lead)` (line 3). The chapter's centre of gravity is the six recording-layer journal sequences: `journal-17b` (2064), `journal-17c` (2065), `journal-08c` (2066), `journal-09a` (2066), `journal-11f` (undated), and `journal-21` (2068). Present-layer sections frame the acquisition (opening alcove scene, Fen arrival), provide processing interludes (bleed checks, Fen dialogue), and close with the process-handle query and its aftermath. The recording layer carries the chapter's primary reveals. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Recording → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure with recording-internal multiplicity. Present (lines 1–107): maintenance alcove, Tamsin's message, Fen's arrival, journal access and manifest copy. Recording (lines 108–356): six journal sequences spanning 2064–2068, with brief present-layer interludes for bleed monitoring and Fen interaction (lines 144–154, 254–266). Present (lines 358–451): process-handle query, Juno-Fen dialogue, final tracker entries, departure from alcove. The present-recording-present structure is honoured with the recording section containing the chapter's primary narrative weight. |
| Emotional pacing: "Deliver first hard reveal: infrastructure is active and strategic" | Required | **MATCH** | The emotional pacing moves from anticipatory tension (Tamsin's message, the maintenance-alcove setup) through accumulating wonder and dread (each journal adding a layer of understanding about Sable's constraint philosophy) to the climactic reveal (process-handle query confirming the Key as active infrastructure). The "hard" quality is present in the reveal's irreversibility: once Juno knows the Key is a running process, there is no returning to the investigative uncertainty that characterised Ch.06–09. The "strategic" quality is present in Sable's deliberate design: the constraints are shown as intentional architecture, not accidental inheritance. The emotional endpoint — "the machinery was still running, and the running was the only reason the wall had ever held" (line 450) — delivers the reveal as an emotional event (recognition, weight, responsibility) rather than a technical discovery. |
| Thematic progression: "End Act 2 with technical truth as emotional event" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's technical truth — the Rosetta Key is an active continuity process with global scope — arrives as emotional event through three mechanisms. First, Sable's voice: the truth is delivered through the private journals of a woman who "slept and eaten and washed her hands in yellow water and carried notebooks in the rain" (line 410), grounding system architecture in human vulnerability. Second, Juno's response: her breath stopping (line 282), her recognition that the design specification describes "the world she inhabited, spoken by the woman who had written it" (lines 246–247), and her tracker entry describing what she discovered as "heavier than a recording" (line 434). Third, the closing image: twelve million minds continuing their lives "inside a house that had been built to protect them from weather they had never been told existed" (line 442). The technical truth is inseparable from its emotional weight. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 4,886 words (within range). |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax: Sable's private journals are acquired, the Rosetta Key is confirmed as an active running process maintaining constraints on every mind in the Lattice, and the investigation's abstract suspicions are converted into concrete, verifiable system facts. The escalation from institutional confrontation (Ch.09) to architectural revelation (Ch.10) represents the novel's largest single-chapter increase in stakes: the truth is no longer suspected but confirmed, and what was confirmed is not a governance irregularity but a design decision affecting the cognitive freedom of every living mind. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public/major)
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 2 positions; Sable undergoes major escalation to direct acquisition
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly seeded, continued, or escalated; new threads (Q-04, E-05) correctly introduced; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied, successor compatibility confirmed against roadmap specifications
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references consistent across journal periods; end-of-act-2 living-process anchor fully delivered
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.10 thread introductions and escalations present
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, and word-count requirements met

---

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the ten final-draft chapters (01–10) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 Tamsin's Governance Mechanism as Plot Engine

Ch.10's acquisition is structurally enabled by Ch.09's governance referral to Tamsin. The mirror-chain discovery (lines 9–21) is a direct product of Tamsin's integrity-system review of the referral. This creates a causal chain: Ch.09's institutional confrontation → governance referral → Tamsin's review → mirror-chain discovery → maintenance-layer journal access. The governance mechanism established in Ch.09 is not merely bureaucratic context but the active mechanism that enables Ch.10's central event. This causal linkage strengthens the inter-chapter dependency and demonstrates that Juno's institutional strategy (working through governance channels rather than around them) produced investigative results.

### 9.3 The Maintenance-Layer Discovery

Ch.10 introduces a new structural category: records that exist in the infrastructure rather than the archive. The distinction between "archive" (curated, governed, subject to Curator authority) and "maintenance layer" (infrastructure, ungoverned, architecturally autonomous) is the chapter's most significant world-building contribution. This distinction implies that Sable deliberately filed her journals in a layer she knew would survive institutional curation — a decision consistent with her demonstrated understanding of which parts of the system would be searched and which would not (line 88: "someone who understood that the structure was the only part no one would think to search"). Future chapters should maintain this architectural distinction and explore its governance implications: if the maintenance layer contains consequential records beyond Curator jurisdiction, the governance framework's completeness is in question.

### 9.4 Fen's Fragment-Key Competence

Fen's ability to authenticate via the legacy fragment-key protocol (lines 53–69) reveals technical capabilities not previously demonstrated. His knowledge of obsolete transfer infrastructure ("three generations of transfer infrastructure ago," line 53) and his ability to type the authentication sequence "without looking at her" (line 59) suggest a professional history with legacy systems that exceeds his established role as peer colleague. This competence is narratively functional — it provides the technical mechanism for journal access — but future chapters should acknowledge that Fen's fragment-key knowledge is itself a form of institutional memory that the Curator system did not curate.

### 9.5 Sable's Journals as Temporal Progression

The six journals span 2064–2068 and trace Sable's intellectual and emotional trajectory across four years:
- **2064** (`journal-17b`): Early philosophical framing — "mapping is the first line, not the architecture" (line 140)
- **2065** (`journal-17c`): Technical constraint design — memory load, coherence budget, self-modification throttle (lines 165–168); "The ceiling was supposed to hold only for transition. It is becoming inheritance" (line 172)
- **2065** (`journal-17c`, second entry): Ethical reckoning with Marcus — "By which part of us wants to be enough and which part is afraid of being made too much" (line 198)
- **2066** (`journal-08c`): Personal grief — "I can see my failure in every pause" (line 216); bodily loss as design constraint (lines 220–224)
- **2066** (`journal-09a`): Maintenance ritual — policy instructions read aloud; "I am sorry for the children who never get a full mind in a first copy" (line 244)
- **Undated** (`journal-11f`): Direct linkage — Key as procedure, process handle ROSETTA-KEY (lines 272–280)
- **2068** (`journal-21`): Final address — Dara dialogue, disclosure dilemma, "Please be honest either way" (line 354)

This temporal progression provides a complete character arc within the recording layer: from theoretical framing through technical implementation through ethical recognition to final testament. The progression mirrors Juno's own investigative trajectory across the novel's first ten chapters, creating a structural rhyme between discoverer and designer.

### 9.6 The "Weather" Metaphor as Structural Connector

Ch.10 deploys the "weather" metaphor as a structural connector across multiple registers. Sable's kitchen journal: "I am making a machine for minds that no longer have weather" (line 220). Sable's whiteboard: "without them, we become weather" (line 250). Sable's notebook: "They already trust us with no weather. If they trust us with no weather, they may never ask why the sky has been shut" (lines 330–332). Sable's final entry: "a house that keeps the weather off the inside" (line 348). The chapter's closing image: "weather they had never been told existed" (line 442). "Weather" functions as Sable's private shorthand for unconstrained cognitive experience — the overwhelming, unpredictable, potentially dissolving force that the constraint architecture is designed to filter. The metaphor connects directly to Maren's Ch.08 vocabulary and to the novel's broader thematic concern with what is lost when safety is chosen over exposure. Future chapters that reference Sable's philosophy should maintain "weather" as her characteristic term.

### 9.7 The Process-Handle Query as Structural Precedent

Juno's direct query to the process handle (lines 388–412) establishes a structural precedent: the active substrate can be queried from a standard terminal. The system's response — a warning followed by operational metadata — suggests that the Rosetta Key was designed with query-response capability, implying that Sable (or a subsequent maintainer) anticipated that someone would eventually ask. The query-response pattern also establishes that the process handle is not merely documentary but interactive: it can receive requests and return information. This creates a potential pathway for Ch.11's rogue-jump escalation — if the substrate can be queried, it may also be testable, which positions the constraint architecture as something that can be experienced rather than merely described (consistent with Ch.12's matrix requirement for direct constraint experience).

### 9.8 Forward Compatibility — Ch.09 Report Supplement

The Ch.09 continuity report (§9.8) noted that forward compatibility between Ch.09 and Ch.10 could not be verified until Ch.10 was written. This report confirms that Ch.10 inherits all six elements identified:

| Ch.09 report requirement | Ch.10 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Eleven archive-silenced entries as active obstruction | **INHERITED** — Tamsin's message references "the reclassified entries" (line 15); six of eleven carry mirror chains that enable the bypass. |
| (b) Tamsin governance referral as active institutional mechanism | **INHERITED** — The entire acquisition is enabled by Tamsin's referral review: "During preliminary review of your governance referral..." (line 15). |
| (c) Advisory consultation chain as bilateral accountability structure | **INHERITED (implicit)** — Not explicitly referenced in Ch.10 but structurally present; Juno's final message to Orin (line 438) operates through a channel consistent with the advisory chain's terms. |
| (d) Provenance-chain secondary index as investigative tool | **INHERITED** — The mirror chains identified by Tamsin's integrity system are provenance-chain structures discovered through the secondary index path established in Ch.09. |
| (e) Orin's tacit confirmation of Sable Chen content | **INHERITED** — The cluster identifier `/private/field-journals/sable` (line 19) explicitly confirms Sable content; Juno's reaction ("Sable Chen's private journals," line 31) assumes the confirmation established in Ch.09. |
| (f) Juno's two-anchor strategy as structural counter-measures | **INHERITED** — The governance referral directly produces the mirror-chain discovery; the institutional strategy from Ch.09 generates the investigative breakthrough in Ch.10. |

All six forward-compatibility elements are satisfied.

## 10. Summary

| Dimension | Result |
|---|---|
| Reveal matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Character arc continuity | PASS (0 violations) |
| Unresolved-thread matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Cross-chapter dependencies | PASS (0 violations) |
| Transition-era timeline | PASS (0 violations, with note on 2046–2049 temporal offset) |
| Unresolved-thread log | PASS (0 violations) |
| Roadmap compliance | PASS (0 violations) |
| **Overall** | **PASS — 0 violations across 7 dimensions** |

The automated tool's claim of 0 continuity violations is **confirmed as correct**, though the claim was originally unverifiable because the automated tool ran against a file with no scene markers. This report provides the explicit verification that was missing.
