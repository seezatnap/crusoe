## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-15.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-15.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 15 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Juno's triage alternatives become explicit: remove constraints, suppress truth, or open truth with agency | **PRESENT** | Ch.15 structures its entire narrative around the explicit presentation of three triage alternatives in a public deliberation setting. **Alternative A — Remove constraints immediately** (lines 191–199): Juno presents this option with its benefit ("full cognitive and perceptual range restored to all minds"), its risk ("identity instability, rapid recursion, accelerated drift in vulnerable populations"), its historical precedent ("early trials showed dissolution, convergence, and memory rewriting in unconstrained conditions"), and its ethical cost ("who bears the damage if removal harms people who did not choose it?"). She explicitly rejects it: "Option A is not mercy. It is emancipation without preparation, and the cost lands on people who did not ask for it. I am not advocating Option A" (line 223). **Alternative B — Suppress architecture indefinitely** (lines 201–209): Juno presents the suppression option with its benefit ("short-term stability maintained"), its risk ("institutional capture through silence, legitimacy decay, trust as a controlled variable"), its historical precedent ("protective stewardship has prevented panic but has also prevented informed self-governance for centuries"), and its ethical cost ("a city cannot consent to what it does not know exists"). She rejects it: "Option B is not safety. It is the shape safety takes when the people administering it have been doing so long enough to mistake their own authority for the system's wellbeing" (line 227). **Alternative C — Witnessed disclosure with retained constraints** (lines 211–219): Juno presents the third option with its benefit ("informed self-governance, distributed choice, consent before modification"), its risk ("short-term upheaval, strategic exploitation of partial comprehension"), its mitigation ("staged framing, independent witness verification, public simulation toolkit, retained constraints as default"), and its ethical cost ("requires everyone to own process, not outcomes"). She advocates for this option: "Option C has no clean name. It does not promise stability. It does not promise freedom. It promises that the people inside this architecture will be told what the architecture does, and will be given the tools to decide — together, witnessed, in public — what to do about it" (line 231). The three-way triage is not merely listed but argued — each option is presented with full moral weight before Juno positions herself. |
| Reveal status: "Public (strategic)" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers public-strategic revelation: the constraint architecture is disclosed to 4,712 watching citizens on a public feed (line 345), with Orin confirming its existence on the record (line 179). The reveal is "strategic" because it is not an uncontrolled leak or an emotional confrontation but a deliberate, structured disclosure with prepared documentation, risk assessment, and a governance proposal. The matrix specifies this reveal "Establishes the ethical center of Act 4 before public crisis begins" — and Ch.15 delivers exactly this: the three alternatives frame the ethical landscape, Option C is argued as the credible third path, and the public deliberation produces a procedural outcome (`public draft released: trial status`, line 359) before the broader political consequences of Ch.16 unfold. The strategic character of the reveal is further confirmed by Juno's preparation (three documents written before the hearing, lines 20–27), Cassiel's projection-system configuration to prevent sequencing manipulation (lines 67, 137), and the witness-chain framework that distributes authority rather than concentrating it. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.15 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the three-way triage chapter described in the matrix, establishing remove/suppress/witness-disclose as the explicit ethical alternatives before Act 4's public crisis. The triage is argued, not merely listed, and produces a procedural outcome that advances the plot into Ch.16.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She resolves the epistemic burden by exposing design truth without collapsing the polity, and chooses a constrained-but-transparent path instead of suppression or dissolution | **PRESENT (initiated — first phase of resolution)** | Ch.15 initiates Juno's Act 4 resolution arc through the public deliberation. She exposes design truth: the constraint architecture summary (lines 143–153) names all four layers in plain language, on a public feed, to an audience of 4,712 citizens. She does so without collapsing the polity: she explicitly rejects Option A ("emancipation without preparation," line 223) and advocates Option C, which retains constraints as default and requires witness consensus before any modification (lines 211–219). She frames the choice not as revolution but as informed governance: "I am not asking you to trust me. I am asking you to read" (line 139). The constrained-but-transparent path is articulated in the eight-point protocol (lines 317–333): publish constraint documentation, activate witness chains, retain constraints by default, require staged simulation before modification, publish harm-response protocols, create anti-suppression audit, establish public glossary, fund integration support. The resolution is initiated rather than complete: the hearing produces a trial-status public draft with a 72-cycle review window (lines 359–369), meaning the exposure has occurred but the polity's response is still forming. Full resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.16's political consequences and Ch.17's emotional closure. |
| Obsession resolved into responsibility | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's obsession — which progressed from curiosity (Ch.01) through fixation (Ch.04) through rogue access (Ch.11) through institutional defiance (Ch.13) through lineage inheritance (Ch.14) — is converted in Ch.15 into public civic action. She does not storm a hearing or break institutional barriers; she prepares three documents (lines 20–27), presents evidence without commentary initially ("let the document hold the room's attention," line 141), and answers questions from every ring with patient specificity (lines 267–269). Her obsession has matured into what the chapter calls "preparation" (line 27), and she understands its limits: "the familiar inadequacy of a person who has done their preparation and understands that preparation is not the same as readiness" (line 27). The distinction between obsession and responsibility is demonstrated by her advocacy approach: she does not demand change but asks people to read (line 139), acknowledges Sable's fears as earned (line 175), and explicitly refuses to advocate for the most radical option (line 223). |
| Risk: obsession resolved too cleanly | **NO VIOLATION** | The resolution is not clean. Juno's account remains under extended hold — "her account was still under extended hold. She could speak. She could not transmit" (line 89). Her bleed markers are elevated (line 9). Her anchor-drift is moderate (line 11). The system recommends she reduce cognitive load (line 13), and she dismisses the recommendation because the recommendation itself is a product of the constraint stack she is disclosing (line 15). Her closing action is not triumph but work: "She stood and stepped toward the channel where the first citizen queries waited for answers that would need to be plain and honest and insufficient" (line 491). The final lines acknowledge the limits: "No one had to tell her the city would not become kind because of this. No one had to tell her it would become less obedient" (lines 493–495). The resolution is earned but incomplete — a civic beginning, not a personal victory. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Faces public and moral costs of long-term custodial deception but is not demonized as purely villainous | **PRESENT** | Orin is Ch.15's most complex institutional figure. He opens the hearing with institutional framing — "governance status of material obtained through lineage access" (line 117) — but his first substantive statement is an apology: "I do not apologise for that maintenance. I do apologise for the cost of its silence" (line 125). The apology is strategic positioning ("By naming the silence first, he claimed ownership of its cost," line 129) but also genuine — Juno sees through the institutional mask to "the face of a person who had maintained a secret for centuries and was watching the room where the secret would end" (line 295). His moral complexity is preserved across four positions. **Position 1 — confirmation:** "What she has described is accurate" (line 179), confirming the constraint architecture's existence on the public record. **Position 2 — continued conviction:** "I maintained the silence because I believed the alternative — unframed disclosure — carried civilizational risk. I still believe that" (line 183). **Position 3 — moral uncertainty:** "But I am no longer certain that maintained silence carries less risk than witnessed truth" (line 183). **Position 4 — institutional withdrawal:** "I will nominate monitoring observers for the first review cycle. I will not nominate myself" (line 349). The withdrawal is not generous but structurally necessary: "the sentence of a man who understood that the system he had maintained could only survive the next phase if the person who had maintained it stepped far enough back to let the room hold its own weight" (line 351). Orin is shown as a person confronting the consequences of centuries-long custodial deception without being reduced to villain or martyr. His fear is acknowledged: "Then I witness. And I fear what follows" (line 307). His continued institutional identity is preserved: "His concerns are noted in the record" (line 353). |
| No overexposure of intentions — moral ambiguity preserved | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain morally layered. His apology is simultaneously genuine and positional (line 129). His confirmation of the architecture is both honest and strategically timed — by confirming before Juno can force him, he maintains institutional credibility. His withdrawal from the monitoring committee is simultaneously self-awareness and self-preservation — a man who understands that the institution must change and who positions himself to survive the change. The chapter preserves the core tension: Orin is a person who maintained a system that prevented panic and prevented consent simultaneously, and neither the prevention of panic nor the denial of consent is resolvable by apology alone. His moral accounting is correctly carried forward to Ch.16's political consequences and Ch.17's emotional closure. |

### 2.3 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Serves as final emotional referendum on whether truth can be held without breaking relational love | **PRESENT (initiated through message exchange)** | Maren appears in Ch.15 through a single message exchange (lines 415–436). Juno sends her the witness-channel status: `disclosure: branch c initiated`, `public: yes`, `constraints: retained until witness process and community review` (lines 419–427). Maren's response arrives slowly — "not from reluctance but from the drift that made every message an act of concentration" (line 429) — and delivers three lines: "strength / is not being right / it is choosing what can be survived when you are not" (lines 431–435). The message functions as an emotional referendum in miniature: Maren, whose confession in Ch.14 transferred the lineage burden to Juno, now responds to Juno's public disclosure by redefining strength as survivable choice rather than correctness. The sentence "offered no comfort. It offered a standard — the kind of standard that did not forgive the people who held it and did not punish the people who could not" (line 437). The relational love is preserved through the act of communication itself: Maren chooses to spend her remaining lucidity on this message, and Juno chooses to send the disclosure status to Maren before anyone else — "Not to Orin. Not to the council. To Maren" (line 415). The full emotional referendum is correctly positioned for Ch.17's final closure, but Ch.15 initiates it by demonstrating that the truth has not broken the relational bond — it has changed the bond's terms from secrecy to witnessed honesty. |
| Drift progression consistent | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's drift is visible in the communication mechanics: responses "arrived slowly" (line 429), her attention "moved through the channel with the careful pace of someone who had been measuring her remaining lucidity and had decided to spend it here" (line 429). The drift has progressed from Ch.14's extended multi-register confession (where lucidity was conserved for a single act of transfer) to Ch.15's compressed three-line message (where lucidity permits only essential words). The progression is consistent: each appearance costs more and delivers less, reflecting a mind that is spending its remaining coherence on communications it considers worth the cost. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps convert revelation into a communal practice of living with uncertainty | **PRESENT** | Cassiel appears in three structural positions in Ch.15. **Pre-hearing** (lines 63–69): he arrives an hour early and adjusts the chamber's projection system so "the central display was keyed to neutral — no party controlled the sequence" (line 103). This technical action is ethically loaded: by preventing any party from controlling the display sequence, Cassiel converts the hearing from a controlled narrative into a communal reading experience. **During hearing** (lines 277–283): his single intervention asks Juno to "Tell them also what the constraints keep" — not to justify secrecy but "To give them the information they need to choose well" (line 279). He opens Sable's field notes on the early trials (line 281), ensuring the room absorbs both the existence of constraints and the reasons they were built. His contribution converts the revelation from a simple disclosure into a practice of holding complexity. **Post-hearing** (lines 395–409, 477–483): he names the irreversibility — "You did something that cannot be taken back" (line 397) — and frames the consequence: "The city now knows what holds it together. That knowledge does not dissolve. It becomes part of the architecture" (line 401). His closing advice — "the city does not need another process. It needs someone who will stand in a room and say what they saw" (line 483) — positions Juno's role as ongoing personal testimony rather than institutional procedure. Cassiel's arc has progressed from Ch.07's emotional distance through Ch.13's private-channel advisory through Ch.14's witness-chain confirmation to Ch.15's active ethical partnership in the hearing itself. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's Ch.15 engagement is the culmination of a correctly paced four-chapter progression: re-entry with distance (Ch.07), private ethical counsel (Ch.13), formal witness commitment (Ch.14), and public partnership in the hearing (Ch.15). His projection-system modification is a practical expression of his ethical position — ensuring the hearing's integrity through technical means rather than emotional appeal. His single spoken intervention is calibrated: he speaks once, from his seat, without standing (line 277), offering a specific and actionable contribution rather than a broad ethical declaration. The relationship with Juno is expressed through attention rather than intimacy: "He met her eyes once as she entered, and the look held no encouragement and no warning. It held the specific attention of a person who intended to be present without being needed" (line 103). The acceptance arc is paced and earned: Cassiel's partnership is operational and ethical, not yet emotionally resolved, with full relational development correctly reserved for Ch.16–17. |

### 2.5 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps stabilize outcomes at the social edge of public exposure and aftermath | **PRESENT** | Fen appears in four structural positions. **Pre-hearing facilitation** (lines 51–81): he arrives twenty minutes early, carries Juno's three documents "without reading — the gesture of a person who trusted the author enough to carry the pages blind" (line 59), provides tactical intelligence about Cassiel's and Orin's preparations (lines 63–77), and departs with Juno for the hearing. **Corridor monitoring** (line 393): he watches the public feed from outside the hall — "I watched the feed from the corridor" — providing external perspective on the proceedings. **Post-hearing stabilization** (lines 381–475): he stands at the railing with the brass disc in his pocket (line 381), absorbs the outcome with a nod that "carried the weight of everything they had done to arrive here" (line 389), and provides the social-edge perspective Juno needs: "You asked for public turbulence. You got it" (line 467). When Juno responds "It is better than public silence," Fen challenges: "It feels the same if you are not inside a chamber" (line 471) — identifying the gap between deliberative-chamber experience and citizen-level experience that Ch.16 must address. His half-smile (line 475) is "Not relief. Recognition. The recognition of a person who has spent months supporting a process he could not control and has arrived at the point where the process has become something that belongs to more than the people who started it" (line 475). His stabilizing role operates through practical observation and tactical challenge rather than emotional support, consistent with his established pattern across fourteen prior chapters. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's concern in Ch.15 is expressed through tactical specificity ("Smaller room. Bigger audience," line 77) and practical challenge ("It feels the same if you are not inside a chamber," line 471) rather than alarm. His alliance is fully operational: he carries documents, monitors from the corridor, provides post-hearing intelligence. His transition from Act 3's tactical facilitator to Act 4's social-edge stabilizer is seamless: the same practical calibration that guided his corridor-threshold stance in Ch.13 and his witness-chain assembly in Ch.14 now manifests as identifying the gap between the hearing's outcome and the public's experience of it. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Functions as historical conscience whose earlier cautions are validated by current constraints | **PRESENT (structurally implicit through testimony content)** | Lena does not appear by name in Ch.15. Her presence is inherited through the evidentiary content Juno deploys. The constraint architecture summary (lines 143–153) — which describes perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary, and drift suppression — is the same architecture Lena raised ethical concerns about during the design era. Juno's description of the early trials — "unconstrained post-body minds experienced perceptual overload, cognitive convergence, and identity dissolution. People lost the ability to disagree with themselves. People rewrote their own memories because the optimisation loop told them the rewrite was more efficient. People forgot their names" (line 171) — echoes Lena's documented concerns about consent limits and system warnings. Sable's field notes, which Cassiel asks Juno to display (line 281), include the five-dimensional room and the man who rewrote his daughter's memory — evidence that originates in the same ethical tradition Lena represented. Lena's historical conscience functions through the evidentiary foundation of the hearing itself: the truth Juno discloses is the truth Lena spent her career warning about, and the hearing's existence validates Lena's caution that concealment could not be sustained indefinitely. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core design ethics become emotionally legible and no longer only plot mechanism | **PRESENT (advanced through public deliberation context)** | Sable appears in Ch.15 through three registers of reference. **As documented architect** (lines 164–175): Juno names Sable directly in the public hearing — "Sable Chen. A computational architect on the original Engram team. She documented her work in field notes that were hidden in degraded structural layers of the Archive" (line 165). Sable's authorship is no longer hidden or inferred but publicly stated. **As moral presence** (lines 175, 189): Juno articulates Sable's dual fear — "She built the constraints because she was afraid of what happened without them. She documented the constraints because she was afraid of what happened with them. Both fears were earned. Neither resolves the other" (line 175). This formulation converts Sable's design ethics from plot mechanism (Ch.12's constraint-architecture exposition) into emotionally legible moral complexity. The three triage options are sourced to "Sable and Maren and the first governance committees" (line 189), establishing that the alternatives are not Juno's invention but the architect's own designed governance framework. **As field evidence** (lines 281–283): Cassiel's request to show "what the constraints keep" leads to a passage from Sable's field notes about the early trials — "the five-dimensional room, the man who rewrote his memory of his daughter" (line 281) — displayed to the public audience without commentary. Sable's words, originally written as private documentation, are now read by a city. The transition from private field notes to public testimony completes the progression from plot mechanism to emotionally legible design ethics. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is preserved in Ch.15 through the hearing's central debate. As protector: the early-trial evidence demonstrates what unconstrained cognition does to people — dissolution, convergence, memory rewriting (line 171). As limiter: the constraint architecture operates on every mind without consent (line 153). Juno's formulation — "Both fears were earned. Neither resolves the other" (line 175) — explicitly maintains the tension. The three-way triage structure itself embodies Sable's dual nature: Option A (remove constraints) honours Sable-as-limiter by acknowledging the cost of constraints, while the early-trial evidence honours Sable-as-protector by demonstrating the cost of removal. Option C (witnessed disclosure with retained constraints) attempts to honour both positions — transparency about the limits with preservation of the protection — and the chapter does not pretend this synthesis is clean or complete. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Can become a late-stage foil or silent beneficiary of institutional continuity | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (inherited through institutional context)** | Marcus does not appear by name in Ch.15. His presence is inherited through the institutional position Orin occupies in the hearing. Orin's opening framing — "material obtained through lineage access during an active continuity hold" and "infrastructure components that have been classified under protective stewardship since their inception" (line 117) — uses the same institutional language Marcus championed in Ch.13's exhibit 13-A. Marcus's pragmatic-suppression pole is structurally present in Option B ("Suppress architecture indefinitely," lines 201–209), whose benefits and precedents map directly to the arguments Marcus articulated in 2068. His absence from the hearing is consistent with his matrix position as "silent beneficiary of institutional continuity" — the institutional framework he helped build continues to function as governance infrastructure even as the hearing challenges its secrecy dimension. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Legitimacy is re-negotiated publicly; truth release challenge reframes Curator authority | **PRESENT (initiated through public hearing)** | The Curator system's legitimacy is publicly re-negotiated in Ch.15 through four mechanisms. **First — public accountability:** the hearing takes place in the Continuity Hall on a public feed with 4,712 citizens watching (line 345). The Curator system's enforcement, which operated through closed proceedings in Ch.13, is now subjected to public observation. **Second — institutional confirmation:** Orin's on-record confirmation that the constraint architecture exists (line 179) converts the Curator system's protective stewardship from classified policy into acknowledged governance, forcing the system to defend itself in the open. **Third — procedural reform:** the eight-point protocol (lines 317–333) reframes Curator authority through specific mechanisms: witness chains requiring non-Curator signatures (line 321), anti-suppression audits with public expiration (line 329), public glossary preventing institutional definition monopoly (line 331). **Fourth — voluntary withdrawal:** Orin's refusal to nominate himself for the monitoring committee (line 349) acknowledges that Curator authority cannot remain unchanged after public disclosure. The re-negotiation is initiated, not complete: the 72-cycle review window (line 363) and the "no enforcement action during active witness window" provision (line 365) create a transitional period during which the old authority structure is suspended but not yet replaced. Full re-negotiation is correctly reserved for Ch.16's political consequences. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The Curator system's enforcement persists proportionately in Ch.15. Juno's account remains under extended hold — "her account was still under extended hold. She could speak. She could not transmit" (line 89). The hold is not lifted during or after the hearing. Two enforcement officers accompany Orin (line 73). The system renders council members in "protocol neutrality" (line 91). These enforcement elements are present but do not escalate: the system accommodates the public hearing, permits Juno to speak, and produces a procedural outcome. The Curator system is shown as institutionally powerful but responsive to public deliberation — it can maintain enforcement while participating in its own re-negotiation, demonstrating institutional resilience rather than omnipotent control. |

### 2.10 Faded/Drifted Legacy

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Marks the moral center of why transparency and consent, not fear, must drive Act 4 resolution | **PRESENT (through multiple registers)** | The Faded/drifted legacy operates in Ch.15 through three registers. **Juno's bleed status:** her elevated bleed and moderate anchor-drift (lines 9–11) demonstrate that she herself carries drift consequences, making her advocacy personal rather than abstract. **Maren's drift-limited response:** Maren's three-line message (lines 431–435) arrives slowly because drift "made every message an act of concentration" (line 429), demonstrating the ongoing cost of living within the constraint architecture. **Public hearing context:** Lien's identification of disclosure as "a grief event" (line 245) and Juno's advocacy for "integration and grief support for citizens who choose to engage deeply with the disclosed material" (line 333) acknowledge that drift-vulnerable populations require support during disclosure, not protection from disclosure. The moral center is articulated through Juno's framing: "People are already living inside limits they do not know about. Panic from learning the truth is not worse than compliance from never being told" (line 241). The Faded and drifted are present not as abstract warning but as the specific population whose right to informed self-governance is at stake. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.15 match their matrix-specified Act 4 positions. Juno initiates public resolution through witnessed disclosure with retained constraints. Orin confronts the moral costs of custodial deception without being demonized. Cassiel converts revelation into communal practice. Fen stabilizes the social edge. Maren's drift progression is consistent. Sable's design ethics become emotionally legible through public testimony. The Curator system's legitimacy is re-negotiated in the open. No premature closure, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.15 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Partially closed by Ch.14 emotional confession; final impact tested in Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (carried forward through message exchange)** | Maren's fear of the Key — partially closed through Ch.14's four-register confession — is carried forward in Ch.15 through her response to the disclosure: "strength / is not being right / it is choosing what can be survived when you are not" (lines 431–435). The message recontextualises her fear: Maren feared the Key not only because of design complicity, lineage burden, and maternal guilt (Ch.14's three layers) but because she understood that the person who eventually disclosed the truth would need a standard for surviving the consequences — a standard she is now providing from within her drift-limited state. The thread is correctly carried forward without premature closure: Maren's fear is explained (Ch.14) and its emotional wisdom is deployed (Ch.15), but the final impact on the Juno-Maren relationship is reserved for Ch.17. |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Mostly resolved Ch.13–14 per matrix | **PRESENT (resolved through public confirmation)** | Ch.15 resolves the Orin-suppression thread through his public statements. His confirmation — "What she has described is accurate" (line 179) — eliminates the possibility that suppression was based on false premises. His admission — "I maintained the silence because I believed the alternative — unframed disclosure — carried civilizational risk. I still believe that. But I am no longer certain that maintained silence carries less risk than witnessed truth" (line 183) — positions his suppression as protective in intent but indeterminate in effect. His apology — "I do not apologise for that maintenance. I do apologise for the cost of its silence" (line 125) — distinguishes between the act of maintenance (which he still defends) and the cost of silence (which he now acknowledges). His self-recusal from the monitoring committee (line 349) demonstrates that he recognises the institutional position cannot continue as before. The resolution preserves moral complexity: Orin's suppression was protective in intent, carried real civilizational risk as justification, and simultaneously denied twelve million people the right to consent. The thread is mostly resolved at Ch.15 — neither malicious nor purely protective but institutionally entrenched and now publicly acknowledged. Final moral accounting is preserved for Ch.16–17. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through three-way triage)** | The Key-removal question is directly addressed through the three-option framework. Option A (lines 191–199) presents immediate removal with its full risk profile: "identity instability, rapid recursion, accelerated drift in vulnerable populations" and historical precedent showing "dissolution, convergence, and memory rewriting." Juno's rejection — "I am not advocating Option A" (line 223) — does not mean removal is impossible but that it requires preparation. Option C (lines 211–219) addresses the question structurally: "Retain all constraints as default. No limit is removed without evidence review, public simulation, and community consent" (line 323). The eight-point protocol provides the governance framework for eventual modification: "For any citizen request to modify a constraint: staged simulation, community notification, reversible boundary. No permanent changes without sustained witness consensus" (line 325). The answer to "can the Key be safely removed?" has evolved from "unknown" (Ch.10) through "dangerous but possible" (Ch.14's infrastructure evidence) to "possible through witnessed governance, not unilateral action" (Ch.15's Option C framework). The thread is correctly advanced to Ch.15's governance level, with final resolution reserved for Ch.17. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Core meaning resolved as moral/structural paradox in Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (publicly articulated)** | The full meaning of Sable's constraints is publicly articulated in Ch.15 through three moments. First, the constraint architecture summary (lines 143–153) describes all four layers in plain language accessible to the general public — the first time the constraints' meaning has been communicated outside investigative or institutional contexts. Second, Juno's formulation of Sable's dual fear (line 175) articulates the moral-structural paradox: constraints were necessary to prevent dissolution and wrong to impose without consent, and neither position resolves the other. Third, the public display of Sable's field notes (line 281) provides the room with direct access to the evidence of what unconstrained cognition produces. The thread has progressed from Ch.12's private doctrinal reveal through Ch.13's institutional contestation through Ch.14's infrastructure-level confirmation to Ch.15's public articulation. The constraints' meaning is now held by a city, not merely by investigators and institutions. Core moral resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Continues as ongoing character condition per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at public-disclosure level)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under the novel stress of public testimony. Her bleed is elevated (line 9), her anchor-drift is moderate (line 11), and she dismisses the system's recommendation to reduce cognitive load because the recommendation is itself a product of the constraint stack (line 15). Her stability during the hearing is demonstrated through sustained coherence: she presents three documents, answers questions from every ring, responds to Orin's arguments, and opens Sable's field notes — all under extended hold with elevated bleed markers. Her awareness of the constraints' presence in her own cognition is explicitly acknowledged: "every object in the room announced itself as a decision someone had made on her behalf" (line 7). She carries the brass disc (line 17) as an anchoring practice she recognises as technically futile but personally meaningful: "some beliefs carried their own weight and the carrying was the point" (line 17). Her closing self-assessment is honest about limits: answers will need to be "plain and honest and insufficient" (line 491). The identity-stability thread is correctly maintained at late-Act-4 intensity: Juno is functioning under sustained stress with explicit acknowledgment of the cost, and the ongoing-condition trajectory is preserved without premature cure. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Tested in co-authored ethical stance during public exposure per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through public hearing partnership)** | The Cassiel/Juno thread advances in Ch.15 through operational partnership in the hearing. Cassiel's pre-hearing projection-system modification (line 103) is a practical act of ethical alignment: he ensures the hearing's integrity through technical means, contributing to the disclosure event without claiming a role in it. His single intervention during the hearing (lines 277–283) is the co-authored ethical stance the matrix requires: he asks Juno to include what the constraints prevent, ensuring the disclosure is complete rather than adversarial. His post-hearing observation — "You did something that cannot be taken back" (line 397) — and his framing of knowledge as architectural ("It becomes part of the architecture," line 401) demonstrate the ethical partnership operating through shared analytical vocabulary. His closing advice ("the city does not need another process. It needs someone who will stand in a room and say what they saw," line 483) models the repair through ethical co-presence rather than emotional reconciliation. The arc's trajectory — from defensive presentism (Ch.07) through private ethical counsel (Ch.13) through public partnership (Ch.15) — is correctly paced. Final relational resolution is reserved for Ch.16–17. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Partially exposed per matrix; Ch.16 full dynamics | **PRESENT (advanced through hearing structure)** | The Council split is visible in Ch.15 through three structural elements. First, the public feed: someone "on the council, or Orin himself" made the feed accessible (line 45), but Juno does not know who — the decision's authorship is itself a manifestation of the split, as the council member who opened the feed may support transparency while others may not. Second, the two council members "whose faces the system rendered in protocol neutrality" (line 91) maintain the anonymity pattern from Ch.13, preventing identification of their positions. Third, Orin's self-recusal from the monitoring committee (line 349) creates a structural vacancy: who fills the institutional-authority role in the new governance framework will reveal the Council's alignment. The split is advanced from Ch.13's forum-level behavioural differences to Ch.15's procedural-outcome level: the hearing produces a trial-status public draft that requires four witness signatures (line 361), and the Council's response to this requirement will expose the split dynamics Ch.16 must address. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ongoing horizon thread per matrix | **PRESENT (addressed through disclosure-framework provisions)** | The Faded/drifted legacy thread is addressed in Ch.15 through the hearing's explicit provisions for vulnerable populations. The risk assessment identifies "accelerated drift in vulnerable populations" as a consequence of constraint removal (line 195). The protocol includes "Fund integration and grief support for citizens who choose to engage deeply with the disclosed material" (line 333) — a direct acknowledgment that disclosure affects drift-vulnerable minds and requires support infrastructure. Lien's identification of disclosure as "a grief event" (line 245) frames the Faded/drifted question in terms of communal emotional capacity rather than institutional risk management. Juno's response — "a witnessed grief event, with support structures and retained safeguards, is preferable to an unwitnessed continuation of a choice that was made for us before we could consent to it" (line 251) — positions the drifted not as people to be protected from truth but as people whose grief must be witnessed and supported. The thread is correctly maintained at Act 4's resolution level: the disclosure framework accounts for drift vulnerability without using it as justification for continued concealment. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.15 escalation point. The matrix-specified three-way triage and public-strategic disclosure are delivered at Ch.15 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.14 (requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture credibly) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.15 inherits Ch.14's resolved truth access as the evidentiary foundation for the three-way triage. The constraint architecture summary (lines 143–153) draws from "Sable's field notes and the infrastructure feed Maren had opened" (line 21) — directly referencing Ch.14's Key access and infrastructure feed. The three triage options borrow "the branch labels from the witness packet the architecture itself had generated — the same three options Sable and Maren and a younger Orin had debated in a room with rain on the window and a fan that ticked too fast" (line 23) — a direct reference to Ch.14's recording sequence. The witness-chain framework built in Ch.14 (Cassiel confirmed, retired Curator requesting documentation, continuity engineer acknowledging) is operationalised in Ch.15: Cassiel serves as hearing delegate (line 39), retired steward Lien serves as confirmed participant (line 41). Without Ch.14's truth access — the infrastructure feed, the audit logs, the governance alternatives, the witness-chain assembly — Ch.15's hearing would lack both the evidentiary content to disclose and the institutional framework to conduct disclosure. The inheritance is complete: Ch.14 provided the information; Ch.15 deploys it in a public forum. |
| Ch.14 + Ch.12 + Ch.13 combined (requires emotional proof, doctrinal proof, and institutional proof before public deliberation is credible) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.15's public deliberation with the complete context that makes it narratively credible. From Ch.12: the constraint architecture is fully documented through Sable's five field observations, giving Juno the technical knowledge to write a plain-language summary that a public audience can comprehend. From Ch.13: the institutional enforcement has been experienced and documented — the hearing, the exhibits, the extended hold — establishing that the institutional path alone cannot resolve the conflict and that public deliberation is necessary. From Ch.14: Maren's emotional proof provides the personal dimension (the architecture was designed by people who feared what they built and maintained by people who inherited the fear), and the Key access provides the infrastructure evidence (audit logs, risk profiles, governance alternatives). Without all three, the public deliberation would lack either the technical basis (Ch.12), the institutional motivation (Ch.13), or the evidentiary authority (Ch.14) that makes Ch.15's disclosure both credible and necessary. The convergence is structurally complete: technical proof, institutional failure, and personal testimony converge in a public forum. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.15 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.16 (requires Ch.15 decision alternatives before public exposure) | Public disclosure completed, institutional response initiated, witness framework established, political consequences pending | **SATISFIED** | Public disclosure completed: the constraint architecture has been described on a public feed to 4,712 citizens (line 345), with Orin's on-record confirmation (line 179). Institutional response initiated: Orin has confirmed and apologised (line 125), recused himself from monitoring (line 349), and a 72-cycle review window has been established (line 363). Witness framework established: the eight-point protocol (lines 317–333) provides the governance structure for Ch.16's political dynamics — witness chains, anti-suppression audits, public glossary, and staged modification requirements. Political consequences pending: the public responses are arriving as questions (lines 453–463), not as rebellion or endorsement, creating the uncertain civic landscape Ch.16 must navigate. Fen's observation — "It feels the same if you are not inside a chamber" (line 471) — identifies the gap between deliberative-chamber experience and public experience that Ch.16 must address. The transition from Ch.15's "hearing outcome" to Ch.16's "public exposure and resistance" is set up by the hearing's procedural conclusion combined with the unresolved question of how the city responds once the initial reading cycle ends. |
| Ch.17 (requires completed public/ethical cycle to provide final closure) | Ethical framework articulated, public disclosure initiated, emotional threads carried forward, institutional authority re-negotiated | **SATISFIED** | Ethical framework articulated: the three-way triage establishes the moral landscape — removal is dangerous, suppression is unjust, witnessed disclosure is costly but credible. Public disclosure initiated: the constraint architecture is public knowledge; the question is no longer whether to disclose but how to govern the disclosure. Emotional threads carried forward: Maren's three-line message (lines 431–435) carries the relational thread; Juno's acknowledgment that the city "would not become kind because of this" (line 493) carries the epistemic-burden thread; Orin's fear (line 307) carries the institutional-accountability thread. Institutional authority re-negotiated: the hearing's outcome — trial-status public draft, witness signatures required, no enforcement during review window — establishes the transitional governance structure that Ch.17 must assess as either stable or failing. Ch.17 has access to the complete ethical, political, emotional, and institutional materials needed for final closure. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.15 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2072–2077: "Legacy stabilization period: practical continuity outpaces doctrine" / "Ch.14 / Ch.15 — archival scenes showing suppression patterns, delayed corrections, and missing chain-of-custody evidence" | Scene anchor for Ch.15 | **PRESENT (through historical-context framing in hearing testimony)** | The timeline's 2072–2077 specification is satisfied through the hearing's historical framing. Juno states: "The architecture was designed between 2048 and 2060. It was hardened into permanent infrastructure by 2066. It has been running without interruption since" (line 161). The risk assessment references "the same three options Sable and Maren and a younger Orin had debated" (line 23) — governance alternatives from the design era that were never enacted, representing the "delayed corrections" the timeline describes. The hearing's central argument is precisely about practical continuity outpacing doctrine: Orin's position is that the system worked ("I have spent centuries maintaining the systems this hearing concerns," line 125), while Juno's position is that the doctrine of protective stewardship has not kept pace with the practical reality of concealed governance. The "suppression patterns" are visible in the hearing's existence itself: the fact that the constraint architecture was unknown to 4,712 watching citizens until Juno described it demonstrates that the legacy stabilisation period's suppression patterns persisted for centuries beyond their original context. |
| 2079–2084: "Post-Lena transition administration formalizes archival partitions and access taxonomy" / "Ch.15 — present-future parallels can include this as historical evidence backing Orin's stewardship posture" | Scene anchor for Ch.15 | **PRESENT (through Orin's institutional framing)** | The timeline specifies that Ch.15 can include post-Lena transition administration as historical evidence backing Orin's stewardship posture. This is satisfied through Orin's hearing statements. His opening — "infrastructure components that have been classified under protective stewardship since their inception" (line 117) — invokes the formalized access taxonomy the 2079–2084 period established. His defence — "I maintained the silence because I believed the alternative — unframed disclosure — carried civilizational risk" (line 183) — uses the same risk-framing language that the post-Lena administration formalized as governance doctrine. His apology for "the cost of its silence" (line 125) implicitly acknowledges that the stewardship posture has outlived the conditions that justified it — the "safe versus restricted" access doctrine formalized after Lena's death has become the institutional default Juno's hearing now challenges. The present-future parallel is structurally present: the hearing re-enacts in a public forum the same tension between protective administration and informed consent that the 2079–2084 period formalized as classified policy. |
| 2085–2089: "Infrastructure hardening and continuity optimization; drift-reduction protocols become mandatory" / "Ch.15 / Ch.16 anchors for political framing: who benefits from 'containment for safety'" | Scene anchor for Ch.15 | **PRESENT (through political framing of constraint-retention debate)** | The timeline's 2085–2089 specification — "who benefits from containment for safety" — is addressed through the hearing's political framing. Option B ("Suppress architecture indefinitely," lines 201–209) presents "containment for safety" in its institutional form: "short-term stability maintained" at the cost of "institutional capture through silence, legitimacy decay, trust as a controlled variable." Juno's rejection — "It is the shape safety takes when the people administering it have been doing so long enough to mistake their own authority for the system's wellbeing" (line 227) — directly answers the "who benefits" question: the administrators benefit from containment because it preserves their authority, while the population carries the cost of uninformed compliance. The hearing's discussion of constraint retention under Option C (lines 211–219, 323) reframes "containment for safety" as a transitional measure subject to public consent rather than an indefinite institutional prerogative. The political framing is correctly positioned: Ch.15 introduces the "who benefits" question through the three-option structure; Ch.16 will develop it through the public response and resistance dynamics. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.15 are satisfied. The 2072–2077 legacy-stabilisation context is present through historical framing and delayed-correction evidence. The 2079–2084 post-Lena stewardship posture is present through Orin's institutional framing. The 2085–2089 "who benefits from containment" political framing is present through the three-option triage structure.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.15 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Ch.10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 per log; resolved into governance decision in Act 4 | **PRESENT (resolved into governance framework)** | Q-04 is directly addressed in Ch.15 through the three-option triage. Option A (lines 191–199) addresses immediate removal: the risks include "identity instability, rapid recursion, accelerated drift" with historical precedent from the early trials. Option C (lines 211–219) addresses modification through governance: "Retain all constraints as default. No limit is removed without evidence review, public simulation, and community consent" (line 323). The witness-chain requirement — "three independent signatures required" (line 321) — establishes the mechanism for constraint modification. The "staged simulation, community notification, reversible boundary" protocol (line 325) provides the safety framework. The thread has progressed from Ch.10's discovery (constraints are active) through Ch.11's testing (rogue access shows what happens outside constraints) through Ch.12's documentation (how the constraints work) through Ch.14's infrastructure evidence (risk profiles and governance alternatives) to Ch.15's governance framework: the constraints can be modified, but only through witnessed consensus with simulation and reversibility requirements. The resolution is structural rather than binary: not "yes/no" but "through what process and with what safeguards." Full implementation is reserved for Ch.16–17. |
| Q-07 (What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control?) | Ch.3, 5, 9, 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (advanced through public re-negotiation)** | Q-07 is advanced in Ch.15 through the hearing's re-negotiation of Curator authority. Orin's statements reveal all three functions simultaneously: preservation ("I have spent centuries maintaining the systems this hearing concerns," line 125), prevention ("I maintained the silence because I believed the alternative — unframed disclosure — carried civilizational risk," line 183), and control (the extended hold on Juno's account persists throughout the hearing, line 89; enforcement officers accompany Orin, line 73). The hearing's outcome reframes the question: the 72-cycle review window (line 363) and the "no enforcement action during active witness window" (line 365) suggest that the Curator layer's function is being converted from unilateral preservation/prevention/control into witnessed governance — a fourth option that the Q-07 framework did not originally include. Orin's self-recusal (line 349) demonstrates that at least one Curator recognises the need for functional transformation. Full resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.16's political sequence. |
| S-02 (Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure) | Ch.10, 11, 14 per log; escalated 15, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated through public disclosure)** | S-02 is escalated in Ch.15 from known-to-investigators to known-to-public. The constraint architecture summary (lines 143–153) describes the Key's active operation in plain language on a public feed: "All four layers are active. All four are maintained by the Rosetta Key process. All four operate on every mind in the Lattice without prior disclosure or consent" (line 153). Orin's on-record confirmation — "The constraint architecture exists. It operates as described" (line 179) — elevates S-02 from secret to public knowledge. The Key's active status is further confirmed through Juno's personal experience: her bleed markers, anchor-drift, and the system's recommendation to reduce cognitive load (lines 9–13) are products of the constraint stack she is publicly describing. S-02 is correctly escalated from Ch.14's infrastructure-level confirmation to Ch.15's public-disclosure level. The secret is no longer a secret — it is a civic fact that 4,712 citizens are processing in real time. Escalation to Ch.17 is preserved for the final assessment of what the city's knowledge changes. |
| S-07 (Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language) | Ch.7, 11, 13 per log; escalated Ch.15, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated through personal disclosure context)** | S-07 is present in Ch.15 through the gap between Juno's personal condition and the hearing's institutional framing. Her bleed is elevated (line 9) and her anchor-drift is moderate (line 11) — ongoing consequences of the rogue jumps that produced the evidence she is now disclosing. The system recommends she "reduce cognitive load for two cycles" (line 13), but the recommendation is itself a product of the constraint stack: "the same perception budget that Sable had documented, the same governance layer that decided what a person in Juno's condition should be permitted to feel" (line 15). The hearing does not address bleed risk directly — Juno's personal condition is not part of the public testimony. This gap between her known risk status and the hearing's focus on architectural disclosure represents the continued downplaying of deep-jump bleed risk: the system that produced the recommendation does not disclose the recommendation's architectural basis, and Juno herself does not make her personal bleed condition part of the public argument. S-07 is correctly escalated at Ch.15's level: the bleed risk is present in Juno's experience but not yet a public topic. Pressure-point escalation to Ch.17 is preserved. |
| E-01 (Is it ethical to hide truth to preserve social stability?) | Ch.3, 4, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16 | **PRESENT (pressure point reached — public deliberation)** | E-01 reaches its Ch.15 pressure point through the hearing's direct engagement with the ethics of concealment. Orin's position: "I maintained the silence because I believed the alternative — unframed disclosure — carried civilizational risk. I still believe that" (line 183). Juno's position: "Option B is not safety. It is the shape safety takes when the people administering it have been doing so long enough to mistake their own authority for the system's wellbeing" (line 227). The hearing does not resolve E-01 by choosing sides — it resolves the dilemma by proposing a third framework: witnessed disclosure (Option C), which acknowledges both the risk of hiding truth (institutional capture, legitimacy decay) and the risk of unframed disclosure (panic, exploitation of partial comprehension). Lien's formulation — "That is not a civic proposal. That is a grief event" (line 245) — introduces a dimension the E-01 framework does not include: the emotional cost to a city that learns it has been governed by hidden architecture. The dilemma is not resolved but reframed: the question is no longer "hide or reveal?" but "how to reveal in a way that respects both the risk of revelation and the moral cost of concealment?" Pressure-point escalation to Ch.16 is preserved. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.9, 10, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16, 17 | **PRESENT (pressure point reached — authority distributed through witness framework)** | E-02 reaches its Ch.15 pressure point through the hearing's explicit redistribution of disclosure authority. The hearing itself is the answer: authority belongs to the witnessed process, not to any single actor. The eight-point protocol distributes authority through three required signatures (line 321), anti-suppression audits with public expiration (line 329), and the prohibition of indefinite holds (line 329). Orin's self-recusal (line 349) — removing the longest-serving custodial authority from the monitoring committee — demonstrates that the institutional holder of authority is voluntarily yielding to the distributed framework. Juno's request to Orin — "Your witness. Not your permission. Not your approval" (line 303) — articulates the distinction between institutional authority (which Orin held) and witnessed presence (which the new framework requires). The citizen queries at the chapter's close (lines 453–463) demonstrate that authority is beginning to distribute: citizens are asking operational questions about constraint modification, rights, and governance procedures, claiming their place in the decision architecture. E-02 is correctly at its Ch.15 pressure point: authority has been redistributed in principle but not yet tested under political pressure. Pressure-point escalation to Ch.16 and Ch.17 is preserved. |
| E-04 (Is public disclosure of historical subjects' private cognitive material justified?) | Ch.2, 4, 5, 6 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 17 | **PRESENT (pressure point reached through public display of field notes)** | E-04 reaches its Ch.15 pressure point when Cassiel asks Juno to show "what the constraints keep" and she opens "a section of Sable's field notes — the passage about the early trials, the five-dimensional room, the man who rewrote his memory of his daughter" (line 281). The public display of Sable's documentation of historical subjects' cognitive experiences raises the E-04 question directly: the man who rewrote his memory of his daughter did not consent to having that experience described in public testimony centuries later. Juno does not address this ethical dimension explicitly — she "let the central display show the words without commentary" (line 281). The hall's response — "the silence of a room absorbing the weight of what it had been protected from and deciding whether the protection had been worth the cost" (line 283) — suggests that the public is processing both the content and the ethical complexity of receiving it. The pressure point is reached but not resolved: the field notes serve the civic purpose of informed consent while raising the personal-privacy question that Ch.17 must address. |
| E-05 (Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy?) | Ch.10, 14, 15 per log; pressure point 16, 17 | **PRESENT (directly addressed through three-option framework)** | E-05 is directly addressed in Ch.15 through the three-option triage. Option A represents full autonomy (remove constraints, accept all risks). Option B represents imperfect safety (suppress truth, maintain constraints). Option C represents a third position: imperfect safety with informed consent (retain constraints as default, allow modification through witnessed process). Juno's advocacy for Option C is the chapter's answer to E-05: a community can choose imperfect safety, but only if the choice is informed, witnessed, and subject to ongoing revision. The citizen queries at the chapter's close (lines 453–463) demonstrate the community beginning to exercise this choice: citizens ask about constraint modification ("can the register explain what happens if the guard is reduced by 10%?"), about the right to choose stronger limits ("do retired citizens have the right to request stronger limits?"), and about governance procedures ("who signs the first witness updates?"). E-05 is correctly introduced at Ch.15's governance level, with pressure-point escalation to Ch.16–17 where the community's choice will be tested under political conditions. |
| E-06 (Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good?) | Ch.12, 14, 15, 17 per log; pressure point 16 | **PRESENT (resolved through witness-chain architecture)** | E-06 is addressed in Ch.15 through the explicit prohibition of single-actor adjustment. The eight-point protocol requires "three independent signatures — affected community representative, continuity staff member, civic observer" for any policy adaptation (line 321). Juno explicitly states: "The constraints cannot be removed by a single person. They are distributed across the infrastructure. Modification requires a witness chain — multiple independent confirmations before any parameter changes" (line 237). She attributes this to Sable's original design: "That is not a limitation I am imposing. It is a feature Sable built into the design" (line 237). The answer to E-06 is structural: constraints should not be adjusted by a single actor, and the architecture was designed to prevent it. Orin's self-recusal from monitoring (line 349) extends the principle: even the institutional actor who maintained the constraints for centuries is removing himself from the adjustment process. The pressure point for Ch.16 is correctly preserved: whether the witnessed framework can withstand political pressure for faster or more radical adjustment remains untested. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Third Gate" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps precisely to its working title. "Third" — the chapter is structured around three options, and Juno advocates for the third: Option C, witnessed disclosure with retained constraints. The "third" has a genealogy: Ch.13's "gate" metaphor (Orin as gate-builder, Juno as gate-opener) is resolved by a third position — neither keeping the gate shut (Option B) nor tearing it open (Option A) but making the gate transparent (Option C). "Gate" — the chapter is set in the Continuity Hall, which functions as the architectural gate between institutional secrecy and public knowledge. The hearing's outcome — `disclosure channel: open` (line 369) — literalises the gate metaphor: the channel is opened, not by destroying the gate but by making it legible. The "gate" also refers to the cognition gate — one of the four constraint layers (line 147) — which continues to operate after disclosure. The title captures the chapter's resolution: the third gate is not Option A (removing the gate) or Option B (maintaining the gate's invisibility) but Option C (a gate that is visible, understood, and subject to witnessed modification). |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 2). The chapter is entirely present-layer — no recording sequences. The action occurs in Juno's work room, the corridor, the Continuity Hall, and the post-hearing station. The lead-layer assignment is correct: Ch.15 is a present-tense public deliberation chapter, not a recording-layer discovery chapter. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Public deliberation → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure. **Present** (lines 1–81): Juno's work room, preparation of three documents, Fen's arrival, departure for the hearing. **Public deliberation** (lines 83–373): Continuity Hall, hearing proceedings including constraint disclosure, three-option presentation, Orin's confirmation and apology, Lien's "grief event" observation, mechanics discussion, Cassiel's intervention, eight-point protocol presentation, Orin's self-recusal, procedural outcome. **Present** (lines 375–498): station outside the hall, Fen and Cassiel reunion, message to Maren, private tracker entry, citizen queries arriving, Juno stepping toward the work that follows. The present-deliberation-present structure is honoured with the public deliberation carrying the chapter's primary triage and the post-deliberation present carrying the chapter's emotional assessment and forward motion. |
| Emotional pacing: "Force irreversible triage among three competing ethics" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's emotional progression moves precisely toward irreversible triage. **Opening** (lines 1–27): Juno has not slept; the shape of things has changed; she has prepared three documents but recognises that "preparation is not the same as readiness" (line 27). The emotional register is anticipatory — the triage is coming but has not yet occurred. **Approach** (lines 29–81): Fen's observation — "Thinking leaves exits. Deciding closes them" (line 57) — frames the hearing as the point of no return. **Deliberation** (lines 83–371): the triage unfolds as public testimony. Each option is argued with full moral weight. The irreversibility is marked by three moments: Juno's disclosure of the constraint architecture (line 139 — cannot be unsaid), Orin's on-record confirmation (line 179 — cannot be retracted), and the public draft's release (line 359 — cannot be recalled). **Aftermath** (lines 375–498): Cassiel names the irreversibility — "You did something that cannot be taken back" (line 397). Juno acknowledges the limits — the city "would not become kind because of this" (line 493) but "would become less obedient" (line 495). The triage is complete: the third option has been chosen, the public knows, and the chapter closes with Juno stepping toward "answers that would need to be plain and honest and insufficient" (line 491). The emotional pacing moves from anticipation through deliberation through irreversible commitment — correctly forcing the triage the roadmap requires. |
| Thematic progression: "Define the third option as hard, costly, and credible" | Required | **MATCH** | The third option is defined through three qualities. **Hard:** it requires institutional transformation — "Your institutions must become both [legible and continuous]" (line 289); it requires community engagement — "requires everyone to own process, not outcomes" (line 219); it has no clean name (line 231) and no guarantee of stability (line 297). Lien names it as "a grief event" (line 245), not a civic proposal. **Costly:** the ethical cost is distributed — "every person in this room — every person watching this feed — is affected" (line 139); the institutional cost is Orin's self-recusal (line 349); the personal cost is Juno's ongoing elevated bleed under extended hold (lines 9–11, 89); the social cost is acknowledged — "short-term upheaval, strategic exploitation of partial comprehension" (line 215). **Credible:** the option is grounded in the architecture's own design — the witness-framework alternatives were "built into the Rosetta Key's witness framework by the people who created the system" (line 189); the eight-point protocol is specific and procedural (lines 317–333); Orin's confirmation validates the evidentiary basis; the hearing produces a formal procedural outcome (lines 359–369); and citizen queries demonstrate that the public is engaging rather than panicking (lines 453–463). The third option is defined as all three: hard, costly, and credible. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,265 words (within range). The roadmap records 4,847 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 5,265. The difference likely reflects inclusion/exclusion of markdown metadata and code-block formatting. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access and critical bleed; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal through Sable's five field observations; Ch.13 converts the doctrinal reveal into institutional confrontation and enforcement; Ch.14 converts institutional impasse into lineage inheritance with full infrastructure access; Ch.15 converts private knowledge into public testimony: the constraint architecture is no longer being discovered, documented, contested, or inherited but *disclosed* — to a public audience, on an open feed, with the institutional custodian confirming its existence and the architect's own governance alternatives framing the response. The escalation from Ch.14's "here is the hidden governance fallback and you are the person it was designed for" to Ch.15's "here is the truth, told publicly, with three options for what to do about it" represents a shift from personal inheritance to civic responsibility — the truth is no longer about what Juno knows or what the institution conceals but about what a city does when it learns that its architecture has been deciding what its citizens are permitted to become. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public / strategic); three-way triage explicitly presented with Option C advocated as the third path
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 4 positions; Juno initiates public resolution; Orin confronts moral costs without demonization; Cassiel converts revelation into communal practice; Fen stabilizes the social edge; Maren's drift progression is consistent
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly continued, escalated, or advanced at Ch.15 level; Key removal resolved into governance framework; Orin's suppression mostly resolved through public confirmation; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied (Ch.14 truth access, Ch.12 doctrinal proof, Ch.13 institutional proof), successor compatibility confirmed against Ch.16 and Ch.17 requirements
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references correctly anchor to legacy-stabilisation context, post-Lena stewardship posture, and "who benefits from containment" political framing
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.15 thread escalations and pressure points present (Q-04, Q-07, S-02, S-07, E-01, E-02, E-04, E-05, E-06)
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, thematic, and word-count requirements met

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the fifteen final-draft chapters (01–15) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Hearing as Architectural Mirror (Continued)

Ch.13's continuity report (§9.2) identified the Curator Continuity Forum as a structural mirror of the constraint architecture — the institution applying a micro-version of the same constraints to Juno that the architecture applies to all minds. Ch.15's Continuity Hall inverts this mirror. Where Ch.13's forum restricted (account freeze, vault lock, environmental stripping), Ch.15's hall opens (public feed, neutral projection, consensus nodes). Where Ch.13's Curators were anonymised behind "protocol neutrality" (Ch.13 line 139), Ch.15's audience is visible as "rings of attention" (line 91) with individual citizens asking questions (lines 157–257). Where Ch.13 produced enforcement (extended hold, no-dissemination order), Ch.15 produces a governance framework (witness chain, anti-suppression audit, public glossary). The inversion is not total — Juno's account remains under extended hold (line 89), enforcement officers accompany Orin (line 73) — but the hearing's architecture demonstrates what institutional legibility looks like when the constraint philosophy is applied transparently rather than covertly. Future chapters should maintain this parallel: Ch.15's hearing is not the opposite of Ch.13's forum but its reformed successor, and the distinction between the two is the same distinction between Option B (covert protection) and Option C (witnessed governance).

### 9.3 The Brass Disc as Continuity Thread

The brass tuning disc continues its role from Ch.11–14. In Ch.15, it appears in three positions: on Juno's console where Fen left it (line 17), in Fen's pocket during the pre-hearing departure (the outline visible "against the fabric," line 51), and in Fen's jacket pocket at the post-hearing railing (line 381). The disc's trajectory mirrors the chapter's emotional arc: in Juno's hands during the solitary preparation (she "turned it in her fingers and counted the grooves," line 17), transferred to Fen's pocket during the shared departure, and visible-but-pocketed during the post-hearing reunion. The disc's progression across Act 3–4 tracks alliance: Ch.12 (left on Juno's console — waiting), Ch.13 (in Fen's pocket during the corridor exchange — carried), Ch.14 (turning in Fen's fingers — anticipating), Ch.15 (in Fen's pocket at the railing — present but at rest). The disc has moved from active use to passive presence, reflecting the shift from investigative tension to civic process.

### 9.4 The "Gate" Metaphor Resolved

Ch.12's continuity report (§9.5) and Ch.13's report (§9.4) tracked the "gate" metaphor's evolution from technical register (cognition gate as constraint mechanism) to political register (institutional gate as governance mechanism). Ch.15 resolves the metaphor through the working title itself — "The Third Gate" — and through three structural uses. First, the cognition gate is described to the public as one of the four constraint layers (line 147): "Cognition gate: limits processing speed and certainty formation." Second, the Continuity Hall functions as a civic gate — the space between institutional secrecy and public knowledge, now opened through the disclosure channel (line 369). Third, the third option is itself a gate: not the locked gate of concealment or the destroyed gate of unregulated disclosure but a gate that is visible, understood, and subject to witnessed modification. The metaphor has progressed from technical (Ch.12) through political (Ch.13) to civic (Ch.15), completing its arc. Future chapters may reference the "gate" vocabulary, but the metaphor's structural work is complete: the gate is open, and the question is now what passes through it.

### 9.5 Lien as Institutional Memory Bridge

The retired steward Lien, introduced in Ch.14 through the witness chain as "a retired Curator requesting documentation" (Ch.14, line 775), appears in person in Ch.15 for the first time. His characterization bridges three institutional eras. His habits — "fingers pressing keys that no longer existed, a body remembering functions it had not performed in decades" (line 253) — identify him as a person who served during a period when governance was physically embodied (panel work with actual keys), connecting him to the transition era's material governance culture. His observation — "You sound like someone I once knew. She built things by admitting what they cost" (line 255) — suggests personal acquaintance with a transition-era figure (likely Sable or Lena, though the sentence "did not require a name," line 257). His assessment of the protocol — "This reads like governance" (line 337) — validates the proposal from institutional experience rather than theoretical principle. Lien functions as a bridge between the transition era (which he appears to remember personally) and the present hearing (which he legitimises through his attendance and endorsement). His role should be maintained in Ch.16–17 as the institutional-memory voice that validates the witness framework's governance credentials.

### 9.6 The 4,712 as Narrative Element

The specific citizen count — 4,712 watching the public feed (line 345) — functions as both procedural detail and narrative element. The number's specificity grounds the disclosure as a real civic event with measurable participation. The number "had been climbing since Orin confirmed the architecture's existence" (line 345) — meaning Orin's confirmation, not Juno's disclosure, was the trigger for increased public attention. This detail preserves Orin's structural importance: the institutional voice's validation carries more civic weight than the investigator's testimony, because the institution's confirmation converts the disclosure from accusation into acknowledged fact. The number "would continue climbing" (line 345) — marking the disclosure as an ongoing process rather than a completed event. Future chapters should track whether the number plateaus (civic fatigue), accelerates (civic crisis), or stabilises (civic absorption) as an indicator of the disclosure's public trajectory.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.14 Report Supplement

The Ch.14 continuity report (§9.7) identified elements Ch.15 must inherit:

| Ch.14 report requirement | Ch.15 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Full infrastructure access with audit logs, risk profiles, and witness branch options | **INHERITED** — Juno's three documents are built from "Sable's field notes and the infrastructure feed Maren had opened" (line 21) and "the branch labels from the witness packet the architecture itself had generated" (line 23). The infrastructure evidence is the hearing's evidentiary foundation. |
| (b) Four governance alternatives (branches a–d) providing framework for three-way triage | **INHERITED AND REALISED** — The four branches are consolidated into three public options (Option A maps to branch_b emergency disclosure; Option B maps to branch_d no-action default; Option C maps to branch_a controlled release + staged witness). The consolidation is narratively appropriate: branch_c (temporary freeze with independent review) is absorbed into Option C's phased approach. |
| (c) Juno's notification to Orin establishing adversarial-to-structured-challenge transition | **INHERITED AND ADVANCED** — The adversarial relationship from Ch.13 and the structured notification from Ch.14 are converted into the hearing's format: Juno and Orin face each other in a public forum where both speak on the record. The transition from adversarial to structured is completed by Orin's confirmation (line 179) and his request for Juno's witness rather than permission (line 303). |
| (d) Witness chain with three confirmed/pending responses | **INHERITED AND OPERATIONALISED** — Cassiel serves as hearing delegate (line 39). Retired steward Lien serves as confirmed participant (line 41). The witness chain built in Ch.14 is the institutional infrastructure for Ch.15's public hearing. |

All four forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.14 report are satisfied and advanced.

### 9.8 Forward Compatibility — Ch.16 and Ch.17

Ch.16 requires public exposure and resistance dynamics. Ch.15 provides: (a) public disclosure completed — the constraint architecture is described on an open feed to 4,712 citizens, with institutional confirmation; (b) governance framework established — the eight-point protocol provides the structure for political contestation; (c) Orin's self-recusal creating institutional vacancy — the question of who fills the governance-monitoring role will drive Ch.16's political dynamics; (d) citizen queries (lines 453–463) demonstrating that the public is engaging with the disclosure material, creating the civic context for Ch.16's "alliance strain, resistance, and social reorganization."

Ch.17 requires completed public/ethical cycle for final closure. Ch.15 provides: (a) the ethical framework articulated through three options with Option C chosen; (b) Maren's emotional thread carried forward through the three-line message; (c) Orin's fear acknowledged and his institutional position transformed; (d) the distinction between disclosure and resolution explicitly preserved — Juno steps toward "answers that would need to be plain and honest and insufficient" (line 491), acknowledging that the public/ethical cycle has begun but not concluded.
