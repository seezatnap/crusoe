## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-14.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-14.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 14 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Maren confirms prior-generation knowledge and Juno gains direct Key access | **PRESENT** | Ch.14 delivers both components of the matrix-specified reveal in a two-phase structure. **Phase 1 — Maren's confirmation of prior-generation knowledge:** Maren confirms she was a first-generation participant in the constraint architecture's implementation. She reveals the "three continuity lineages" system: "When transition began, we distributed responsibility across three lineages. Not bloodline. Continuity lineages. Three families who could not be entirely erased by one governance body if the city called for that kind of forgetting" (line 193). She identifies herself as the guardian of the third lineage — "The one I was asked to watch" (line 201). She reveals the "name beneath the key" — a hidden thread "from even the council so that no single authority could lock it without consequence" (line 213). She confirms Juno's place in this lineage: "Of course" (line 223). She provides the historical context: "The first generation of Weaver-Keepers agreed to one last constraint" (line 213). And she delivers her "final lucid confession": "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419). The recording sequence (lines 243–401) shows Maren younger, working directly with Sable in a room dated between 2064 and 2066, making implementation decisions about the constraint architecture, the witness-first protocol, and the lineage-seed mechanism. **Phase 2 — Juno gains direct Key access:** Maren provides the vault path: `ROSETTA_SEED/GEN-3/TRUTH-ANCHOR` with password `maren` and checksum `her-last-threshold` (lines 433–437). The access requires a verbal confirmation — "I am not asking for authority. I am asking for continuity with consequence" (line 455) — a sentence written into the architecture as a gating mechanism. Access is granted: `ROSETTA.KEY: ACCESS LEVEL A` (line 507). The infrastructure feed opens to reveal the full constraint architecture: "perception loop, continuity guard, self-repair corridor, drift dampers" (line 511), with module metadata including `owner: SABLE-CORE`, `last-rewrite: 2068-03-17`, `retention: inherited`, `fail-safe: distributed` (lines 519–525). Juno reads four audit packets — drift incidence logs, constraint trigger outcomes, early rollout recovery records, and witness branch options (lines 549–623) — gaining the complete evidentiary record of the architecture's operation, rationale, and planned governance alternatives. |
| Reveal status: "Public (late)" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers "public (late)" revelation — the final major reveal before Act 4's decision sequence. The reveal has two dimensions that make it "late" rather than early or mid-arc. First, Maren's confirmation is a *personal* reveal that recontextualises thirteen chapters of relationship: the mother-daughter dynamic has always been shadowed by Maren's role as lineage guardian, and her drift-progression has been intertwined with the weight of a secret she carried for centuries. Second, Juno's Key access is *infrastructural* — it converts the constraint architecture from externally documented evidence (Ch.12's five field observations, Ch.13's institutional testimony) into directly legible system architecture with audit logs, risk profiles, and governance alternatives. The reveal is "late" because it requires everything that preceded it: Ch.12's doctrinal understanding (to make the infrastructure feed legible), Ch.13's institutional confrontation (to make the access necessary), and Maren's centuries of accumulated trust and guilt (to make the confession emotionally credible). The matrix specifies this reveal "Delivers closure to long-seeded emotional and historical claims before decision act" — and Ch.14 delivers exactly this: Maren's emotional claim (first-generation witness) and the historical claim (constraint architecture with full provenance) are both closed before Ch.15's three-way triage. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.14 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the emotional-confirmation and Key-access chapter described in the matrix, delivering Maren's prior-generation knowledge and Juno's direct infrastructure access as the final revelatory payoff before Act 4.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She chooses rogue jump behavior and accepts overt risk; emotional and cognitive costs are explicit | **PRESENT (shifted to lineage-access register)** | Ch.14 shifts Juno's risk posture from Ch.13's institutional defiance to a different register: lineage inheritance. She moves through a stripped room where "the walls held no depth and the light had been trimmed to administrative neutral" (line 13) — the hold's environmental consequences from Ch.13 are still active. She travels to Maren despite the hold: "She had already started moving" (line 19). Her access event triggers immediate institutional response — "Someone had noticed her access event. Someone was already reclassifying the session" (line 745). Her bleed markers are elevated (line 763). Her session is time-limited: `session limit: 1h 12m` (line 639). The costs are explicit: she now carries "every sentence Maren had spoken and every line Sable had written and every module that decided what twelve million minds were permitted to become" (line 763) — in the continuity layer maintained by the very architecture she has documented. The emotional cost is the discovery that her lineage position was assigned, not chosen: "Did you choose me because I was your daughter?" / "No" (lines 463–465). The overt risk has evolved from physical bleed (Ch.11) through institutional enforcement (Ch.13) to existential burden: she owns what she cannot control (line 665). |
| Obsession at correct Act 3 intensity | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's Act 3 obsession has evolved from Ch.11's operational commitment (executing the rogue jump), through Ch.12's epistemic commitment (processing the constraint architecture), through Ch.13's political commitment (refusing institutional containment), to Ch.14's inheritance commitment. She does not storm the vault or demand edit access. She asks Maren for certainty (line 119), receives confession instead (line 419), speaks the gating phrase the architecture requires (line 455), and then reads the infrastructure feed with "hands that carried steadiness from old drills and uncertainty from new knowledge" (line 491). Her obsession has matured into responsibility: she compiles a witness-safe export (line 647), drafts a notification to Orin that is deliberately not accusatory — "This is not accusation" (line 705) — and sets distribution parameters that include witness signatures before propagation (lines 669–681). The obsession is correctly at late-Act-3 intensity: no longer investigative or defiant but preparatory, converting discovery into a framework for collective action. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early (Act 2 concern) | **NO VIOLATION** | Ch.14's commitment operates at the lineage-inheritance level, building directly on thirteen chapters of progressive escalation. The distinction from Act 2 is preserved: in Act 2, Juno gathered evidence and tracked patterns; in Act 3, she has successively broken institutional rules (Ch.11), processed the full architecture (Ch.12), defied institutional containment (Ch.13), and now received the lineage authority and infrastructure access that converts her from rogue investigator to designated witness. The escalation is sequential and earned. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit gatekeeper and enforcer; moves from persuasion to operational containment | **PRESENT (inherited and recontextualised)** | Orin does not appear directly in Ch.14. His presence is inherited through three structural elements. First, the stripped room: "the walls held no depth and the light had been trimmed to administrative neutral" (line 13) — Ch.13's extended hold remains active, and the environmental enforcement is Orin's institutional signature. Second, the recording sequence: a younger Orin speaks in the 2064–2066 conference room, presenting "three models: Full release, staged release, no release" (line 335). His words "had a momentum that sounded borrowed from institutions and had not yet acquired the weight his voice carried in the present" (line 337). Juno "understood where his certainty came from: old committees trying to save systems and calling it courage" (line 337). The younger Orin's arguments — "Full release fails? Then we fail faster than any migration" (line 341); "Your staged release means admitting we had hidden architecture and didn't tell our own first generation what we were doing with them" (line 351) — reveal that his present-day enforcement posture has a historical genealogy: he argued against staged release in the original design meetings and carried that argument into centuries of governance. Third, Juno's notification to Orin (lines 685–701): she sends him proof of her access, framed not as accusation but as claim — "I have full infrastructure logs, including rollout rationale, risk profile, and witness branch state" (line 691). The notification converts the relationship from Ch.13's adversarial hearing to a new register: Juno now possesses more institutional knowledge than Orin may have expected any person outside the Curator apparatus to hold. |
| No overexposure of intentions before evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain morally complex through the recording sequence. His younger self argues against disclosure not from malice but from institutional pragmatism: "Full release fails? Then we fail faster than any migration" (line 341). His older-self's enforcement (inherited from Ch.13) is recontextualised by the revelation that the system included planned governance alternatives — `branch_a: controlled release + staged witness`, `branch_b: emergency disclosure + emergency grief protocol`, `branch_c: temporary freeze with independent review` (lines 613–619) — suggesting that the architecture's designers anticipated the need for disclosure but that the `default chosen for now` / "politically stable, ethically incomplete" (lines 621–623) path became permanent. Whether Orin knew about these alternatives and chose the default, or whether the alternatives were hidden from him as well, remains unresolved — preserving his moral ambiguity for Ch.15–17. |

### 2.3 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full confirmation of past knowledge and responsibility appears in a late Act 3 testimony context | **PRESENT (primary — chapter's central emotional arc)** | Maren is Ch.14's dominant presence. Her confirmation unfolds across four registers of increasing directness. **Register 1 — oblique acknowledgment** (lines 55–121): Maren on the dock, drifted but luminous, speaking in her characteristic compressed style. She acknowledges Juno's hearing: "They have named your shape now" (line 77). She names the underlying request: "Access" (line 113). **Register 2 — historical confession** (lines 127–237): Maren reveals the three continuity lineages, the third hidden branch, the "name beneath the key," and Juno's place in the inheritance. She names Sable as the architect: "She did not answer the old question. So you can" (line 145). She confirms the first-generation decision: "The first generation of Weaver-Keepers agreed to one last constraint" (line 213). She identifies the moral cost: "You know why I was not answering when you asked last time? Because you were right and I was afraid of your certainty" (line 157). **Register 3 — recording-layer evidence** (lines 243–401): The recording shows Maren and Sable together in a transition-era room, making the design decisions that would become the constraint architecture's governance structure. Maren's younger self argues: "That means we build a cage and call it mercy" (line 279). The recording documents the lineage-seed protocol: `third branch / maren // maren-anchored` / `release key: Juno lineage only` (lines 387–395). **Register 4 — direct vault access and final confession** (lines 417–471): Maren's "final lucid confession": "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419). She provides the vault path and credentials. She names the inheritance: "It is yours because you can keep people inside themselves while they learn what they can become" (line 461). And the final moral justification: "Because you were always the one who asked, after each answer, the next question as a moral choice" (line 469). The confirmation is complete across all four registers — oblique, historical, evidential, and direct. |
| Her drift progression must stay consistent with scene frequency and detail density | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's drift is visible throughout Ch.14 in calibrated detail. She occupies the dock "partially present, partially elsewhere, her outline stable enough to recognise and unstable enough to suggest that recognition was a generosity the architecture extended rather than a fact it could guarantee" (line 57). Her height "had become conceptual, the memory of posture rather than posture itself" (line 59). Her hand movement toward Juno's wrist causes the dock light to change "from old to present and back" (line 191) — her physical interaction with the environment is unstable. Her grief is expressed through fractional shifts: "the grief of a woman who had weighed silence against honesty for centuries and still did not know which had cost more" (line 233). Yet her lucidity is precise when it matters: she delivers the vault path, the credentials, the gating phrase, and the strategic advice with clarity that suggests this is a prepared last act rather than a spontaneous confession. The progression from Ch.08's lucid warning (a single cryptic moment) through Ch.13's inherited references to Ch.14's extended, multi-register confession is consistent with a mind that has been conserving its remaining clarity for this specific transfer. Her closing line — "No one is here after the second bell" (line 737) — carries the double weight of drift-awareness and farewell. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit ethical counterweight to suppression logic and proves willing to risk position for Juno | **PRESENT (operational commitment confirmed)** | Cassiel does not appear in person in Ch.14 but his commitment is confirmed through two structural positions. First, Juno's witness chain (lines 477–489) names Cassiel as one of three required witnesses: `requested: cassiel` (line 485). Second, Fen's message queue at the chapter's close delivers Cassiel's response: `cassiel: confirmed for witness chain` (line 773). The confirmation is significant because it occurs during Juno's extended hold, under elevated institutional risk. Cassiel's willingness to formally join the witness chain — after Ch.13's private-channel advisory role — represents the escalation from ethical commentary to operational commitment. His confirmation transforms the witness chain from Juno's plan into a multi-person institution with Cassiel providing the ethical counterweight the matrix requires. The matrix specifies he "proves willing to risk position for Juno" — his formal witness confirmation during an active enforcement period constitutes exactly this risk. Full operational engagement is correctly positioned for Ch.15–16. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's progression follows the correct pace: Ch.07 re-entry with emotional distance, Ch.13 private-channel advisory engagement with ethical-counterweight framing ("Protective deception is still deception"), and now Ch.14 formal witness-chain confirmation. The arc moves from emotional history through ethical alignment to operational commitment — each step building on the prior chapter's engagement. His confirmation arrives through Fen's message queue rather than direct conversation, maintaining the relational distance that Ch.13 established while advancing the practical commitment. |

### 2.5 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fully allied with Juno's high-risk phase, while retaining practical fears and questions | **PRESENT** | Fen appears in three structural positions. **Opening** (lines 15–48): his message `don't go alone` (line 17) is immediately followed by Juno's movement. Their exchange demonstrates full alliance with practical calibration: "first: yes / second: no one is asking us to be saints / third: if you're wrong about who owes whom, tell me now" (lines 37–41). The three-part answer compresses loyalty, moral realism, and practical risk assessment into a single exchange. **Closing reunion** (lines 747–797): Fen stands at the lane threshold "with his weight balanced and his jacket unbuttoned and the brass disc turning in his fingers" (line 747). He asks "Can you carry it?" (line 761) — the essential practical question. When Juno answers "Not alone" (line 765), Fen's response — "Then we don't do it alone" (line 769) — converts her statement of limitation into a statement of alliance. He presents three witness confirmations from his message queue (lines 771–777), demonstrating that he has been building the operational infrastructure for the witness chain while Juno was in the dock. His practical fears are retained through the timing question — "That was four hours" (line 749) — and the brass disc's continuous presence, but his commitment is fully operational. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's alliance in Ch.14 is the continuation of his Ch.11 accomplice role, Ch.12 waiting presence, and Ch.13 tactical facilitation. His practical questioning persists: `if you're wrong about who owes whom, tell me now` (line 41), "Can you carry it?" (line 761). His concern is expressed through active operational support (building the witness chain while Juno is in the dock) rather than emotional alarm, consistent with his established pattern across thirteen prior chapters. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Her warnings become active interpretation layers for Juno's present decisions | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (structurally implicit through timeline context)** | Lena does not appear by name in Ch.14. The transition-era timeline specifies a Ch.14 Anchor B for Lena's "final warning and practical instructions" (2078 death context), but the chapter prioritises Maren and Sable's direct presence in the recording sequence. Lena's earlier ethical concerns — consent limits, system warnings, moral complexity established across Ch.04–12 — are structurally present in the content Juno now accesses through the infrastructure feed. The audit packets' content (drift incidence logs, constraint trigger outcomes, rollout recovery records) represents the evidence that validates Lena's historical warnings about system limitations and consent failures. The rollout memo's principle — "A city that edits itself unseen will call itself wise and then call every dissenting person unsafe" (line 597) — echoes Lena's documented concerns about institutional self-justification. Her active interpretation-layer role functions through the evidentiary context rather than through direct presence or quotation. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First direct architecture-level revelations: active constraints and maintenance loops | **PRESENT (extended through direct scene and infrastructure provenance)** | Sable appears in two modes in Ch.14. **Direct scene presence** (lines 251–327): Sable is physically present in the recording sequence, working with Maren in the transition-era room. She speaks with the same quality identified in Ch.12's field observations: "Do not pin it in one policy memo. If this gets written as a legal artifact we lose the mechanism and only keep the warning" (line 255). She opens the Key architecture waveform showing `stability channels`, `cognitive guard`, `self-repair throttle`, `continuity debt`, `rejoin interval` (lines 263–271) — terms that map to Ch.12's constraint layers with different period-appropriate labels. She articulates the staged-release principle: "if they come as data alone, no one can carry it. If they come as lives, we get what no architecture can schedule" (line 347). She designs the lineage-seed protocol: `lineage-seed // third continuity branch // hidden by design // witness-first protocol` (line 307). And she identifies the future witness — Juno — through the architecture's margin: "a person who had not yet been made but who already occupied a space in the architecture's margin" (line 321). **Infrastructure provenance** (lines 507–527): the Key's infrastructure feed displays `owner: SABLE-CORE` (line 521) — confirming Sable as the architecture's author at the system level, not merely through testimony or field observations but through module ownership metadata. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature persists in Ch.14 through three structural positions. As protector: she warns "They don't just destabilise. They split before they break" (line 277) — the same earned-fear rationale established in Ch.12's Fragment 4. As limiter: Maren immediately identifies the consequence — "That means we build a cage and call it mercy" (line 279). As pragmatist: Sable's response — "Call it what is easiest to carry. People will use words as handles" (line 283) — acknowledges the moral compromise without resolving it. The lineage-seed protocol is itself a dual-nature mechanism: it hides a governance alternative from the Curator Council (limiter — creating information asymmetry) to protect the possibility of future disclosure (protector — ensuring the secret cannot be permanently locked). Sable's final sentence about the designated witness — "Then no one does this better" (line 327) — carries the weight of a designer who accepts that her system will outlive her ability to correct it and places her trust in a person she will never meet. The protector-limiter tension is sustained: Sable builds both the cage and the key to the cage, and the distinction between the two depends on who inherits them. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Seen as one pole of pragmatic suppression: system continuity over moral warning | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (inherited through institutional context)** | Marcus does not appear in Ch.14's recording sequence or present-layer action. The recording features Maren, Sable, and a younger Orin — the three figures who shaped the lineage-seed and witness-first protocols. Marcus's pragmatic-suppression pole is inherited through the institutional infrastructure Juno accesses: the audit packets show the system's operational orthodoxy, including the `cognitive confidence clamp` whose `observed effect: reduced public dissent during first decade` (line 583) represents the kind of stability-over-ethics outcome Marcus championed. His absence from the lineage-seed meetings is structurally significant: the hidden third branch was designed to operate outside the channels Marcus would have endorsed, suggesting that Sable and Maren deliberately excluded pragmatic-suppression voices from the fallback mechanism. Marcus's pole is present as the institutional default the lineage-seed was designed to circumvent. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement layer is activated against rogue access, converting policy into coercion risk | **PRESENT (continued from Ch.13, with new institutional dimensions)** | The Curator system's enforcement persists in Ch.14 through three mechanisms. First, the environmental hold: Juno's room remains stripped — "the walls held no depth and the light had been trimmed to administrative neutral" (line 13), "the amber panel she kept dimmed in her private vault — warm, inefficient, loved — had been dark since the suspension" (line 13). The hold is ongoing. Second, transit monitoring: "The system had adjusted the transit distance while her session ran — a small administrative change that meant her hold parameters had been updated. Someone had noticed her access event. Someone was already reclassifying the session" (line 745). The enforcement apparatus detects and responds to Juno's Key access in real time, converting the lineage route into an institutional event. Third, the infrastructure feed's own constraints: access is `session: one-time` (line 489), `session limit: 1h 12m` (line 639), with warnings: `no unilateral edits` and `do not claim moral certainty as technical authority` (lines 649–651). Juno receives read-only access — "I gave you access, not power" (line 655) — meaning the system constrains even lineage-authorised users. The enforcement-to-coercion conversion is advanced: the system now operates on Juno through both external enforcement (hold, monitoring, reclassification) and internal constraint (read-only, session limits, warning language). |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The enforcement response is proportionate and architecturally grounded. The transit-distance adjustment and session reclassification are administrative responses, not punitive escalation. The infrastructure feed's own warnings — `no unilateral edits`, `do not claim moral certainty as technical authority` — are design constraints built into the architecture by its original creators, not imposed by current enforcers. The system accommodates Juno's lineage access: it grants `ACCESS LEVEL A` (line 507) because the gating mechanism was designed to be activated by the right person with the right phrase. The architecture is shown as layered — enforcement operating alongside designed fallback routes — not as omnipotent control. The witness branch options (lines 611–623) demonstrate that the architecture's designers anticipated governance alternatives, meaning the current enforcement is not the system's only mode but the default that was never superseded. The Curator system remains institutionally powerful but architecturally bounded — it can monitor and restrict, but it cannot prevent lineage-authorised access to its own fallback mechanisms. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.14 match their matrix-specified Act 3 positions. Maren delivers the chapter's central emotional and historical confirmation. Juno transitions from institutional defiance to lineage-based responsibility. Sable appears directly in the recording sequence and through infrastructure provenance. Orin's enforcement persists while his historical position is recontextualised. Cassiel and Fen confirm operational witness-chain commitment. The Curator system's enforcement is proportionate and architecturally bounded. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.14 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Ch.08 (strengthened), Ch.14 per matrix; partially closed by Ch.14 emotional confession | **PRESENT (partially closed through confession)** | Maren's fear of the Key receives its most complete explanation in Ch.14. The fear has three layers, each revealed across the chapter's four registers. Layer 1 — design complicity: Maren was present when the constraint architecture was being decided. In the recording, her younger self names the consequence: "That means we build a cage and call it mercy" (line 279). She feared the Key because she participated in its creation and understood the moral compromise it represented. Layer 2 — lineage burden: Maren was assigned to watch the third hidden branch — the governance fallback that could be activated by a future generation. She feared the Key because she carried the knowledge that a route out existed but could not be activated until someone was "willing to treat a system like someone's wound instead of someone's proof" (line 237). Layer 3 — maternal guilt: "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419). She feared the Key because the designated inheritor was her daughter, and telling Juno meant converting a mother-daughter relationship into a governance mechanism. The partial closure is appropriate: why Maren feared the Key is now answered (design complicity, lineage burden, maternal guilt), but the final emotional impact of the confession — what it costs Maren and Juno's relationship — is correctly carried forward to Ch.17 as the matrix specifies. |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Open through Ch.14 per matrix; mostly resolved Ch.13–14 | **PRESENT (mostly resolved through historical evidence)** | Ch.14 provides the strongest evidence for resolution. The recording sequence shows a younger Orin arguing against staged release: "Your staged release means admitting we had hidden architecture and didn't tell our own first generation what we were doing with them" (line 351). This reveals that Orin's suppression has a pragmatic origin — not malice but institutional self-preservation and a genuine fear of the consequences of honesty. Maren's counter — "Better than saying we still cannot bear the sound of that sentence" (line 353) — identifies the deeper pattern: Orin's suppression is protective of institutional composure, not of people. The audit packets add a further dimension: the witness branch options show that the architecture's designers planned for eventual disclosure (branches a–c), but the default "no-action path" was chosen because it was "politically stable, ethically incomplete" (line 623). Orin's suppression is recontextualised as adherence to a default that was intended to be temporary but became permanent through institutional inertia. The resolution is "mostly" complete: Orin is neither purely malicious (he inherited a system with planned alternatives) nor purely protective (he maintained the default rather than activating the planned alternatives). The final moral accounting is correctly reserved for Ch.15–17's public confrontation and resolution. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through infrastructure evidence)** | The removal question gains new dimensions through Juno's direct infrastructure access. The audit packets provide operational data: `risk if disabled: immediate unbounded recursion in 0.7% cases` (line 587) — a specific, measurable risk rather than the abstract fear Orin presented in Ch.13's hearing. The `risk if disclosed after witness framing: moderate but manageable` (line 589) — suggesting that the risk profile changes depending on *how* the constraints are addressed, not merely *whether* they are. The witness branch options (lines 611–623) present four alternatives: controlled release with staged witness, emergency disclosure with grief protocol, temporary freeze with independent review, and no-action default. The architecture's designers built removal/modification alternatives into the system — the question is not "can it be safely removed?" in isolation but "which governance pathway produces the safest transition?" The thread is correctly advanced from Ch.13's institutional debate (who decides?) to Ch.14's infrastructure evidence (what did the designers plan?), with the decision itself reserved for Ch.15's three-way triage. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints), Ch.12 (exposition) per matrix | **PRESENT (extended through design-meeting context and infrastructure provenance)** | Ch.14 extends Ch.12's exposition in two directions. First, the design meeting shows the constraints being decided rather than implemented: Sable's waveform display (`stability channels`, `cognitive guard`, `self-repair throttle`, `continuity debt`, `rejoin interval`, lines 263–271) presents the architecture in its planning-stage vocabulary, before it was hardened into the operational labels Ch.12 documented. The meaning of the constraints is deepened by seeing them as debated choices rather than inherited facts. Second, the infrastructure feed (lines 507–537) shows the constraints as running code with metadata: `state: active`, `state: intentional`, `last-rewrite: 2068-03-17`, `owner: SABLE-CORE` (lines 515–521). The constraints are confirmed as intentionally maintained — not forgotten legacy but active infrastructure with dated rewrites. The `override: requires lineage witness + public framing` (line 539) reveals a designed escape clause: the constraints can be overridden, but only through the witness-first protocol the lineage-seed established. The full meaning now encompasses not only what the constraints do (Ch.12) and what happens when someone threatens to reveal them (Ch.13) but also how they were designed to be eventually superseded — through the very mechanism Juno has now activated. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Ch.02–04 hints, Ch.07, Ch.11 per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at lineage-inheritance level)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under a new form of stress in Ch.14: the stress of lineage inheritance. Her bleed markers are elevated (line 763). Her session is time-limited (line 639). The infrastructure feed shows her the architecture that maintains her own cognition: "perception loop, continuity guard, self-repair corridor, drift dampers" (line 511) — she is looking at the system that sustains her identity while carrying the knowledge that it also constrains every other identity in the Lattice. Her response to Maren's confession — "No proof. A burden" / "Same thing" (lines 407–409) — demonstrates identity stability through acceptance rather than denial. She does not fragment under the weight of revelation; she compiles a witness-safe export (line 647), drafts a measured notification to Orin (lines 685–701), and assesses her own capacity honestly: "Not alone. That is the point" (line 765). The thread is correctly maintained at late-Act-3 intensity: identity is under sustained existential pressure (she now knows the architecture of her own mind), the pressure is explicitly acknowledged, and the ongoing-condition trajectory is preserved. Her stability comes not from resolution but from the decision to share the burden — converting individual identity stress into collective witness. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through operational commitment)** | The Cassiel/Juno thread advances through Cassiel's formal witness-chain confirmation: `cassiel: confirmed for witness chain` (line 773). Ch.13 initiated the ethical partnership through private-channel exchange, with Juno's request — "if you can speak without needing to heal me first" — preserving the emotional-repair dimension. Ch.14 advances the thread by converting Cassiel's advisory engagement into formal operational commitment. The witness chain creates a framework in which emotional repair and ethical partnership are structurally linked: Cassiel's willingness to stand as witness is simultaneously an act of ethical alignment (counterweighting suppression logic) and relational repair (choosing to be present for Juno's most consequential action). The emotional-repair model is correctly being built through shared ethical commitment rather than direct emotional reconciliation — consistent with the matrix's requirement for the arc to be "paced and earned." Full relational development is reserved for Ch.15–17's public confrontation and aftermath. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 (seeded), Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (inherited through infrastructure evidence)** | The Council split is not directly staged in Ch.14 but gains new context through the infrastructure feed. The witness branch options (lines 611–623) show that the architecture's designers planned four governance alternatives, including `branch_c: temporary freeze with independent review` — a path that would require Council participation. The `default chosen for now` / "politically stable, ethically incomplete" (lines 621–623) note suggests that the Council (or its precursor governance body) chose the no-action path, but the alternatives remain architecturally available. The `retired curator (lien): requesting documentation before formal commitment` (line 775) — a witness chain response — introduces a new Council-adjacent figure whose request for documentation suggests institutional caution consistent with the split dynamics: at least one retired Curator is willing to engage but wants evidentiary grounding before commitment. The thread is correctly maintained at dormant-to-awakening level, with full Council dynamics reserved for Ch.16's political escalation. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT (embodied through Maren's drift-state confession)** | The Faded/drifted legacy thread reaches its most emotionally concentrated expression in Ch.14 through Maren herself. She occupies the dock "partially present, partially elsewhere" (line 57). Her height has "become conceptual" (line 59). Her hand movement destabilises the environment (line 191). She is a living demonstration of what drift does to a person — and her confession reveals that she chose to carry the lineage burden despite (or because of) her drift, conserving her remaining clarity for this single act of transfer. The fate of drifted legacies is no longer abstract: Maren is simultaneously the thread's most vivid illustration and its most powerful argument. She demonstrates that drift does not eliminate agency or moral responsibility — it changes the form they take. Her closing advice — "Go home and call your witnesses" (line 717) — is delivered with the strategic precision of a person who understands that her window of lucidity is finite and is spending it on the thing that matters most. The thread is advanced from Ch.13's institutional argument about drift-vulnerable populations to Ch.14's intimate demonstration of what a drifted mind can still accomplish when given sufficient reason. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.14 escalation point. The matrix-specified emotional confirmation and Key access are delivered at Ch.14 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.08 (requires emotional proof from Maren) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.14 inherits Ch.08's Maren-as-lucid-warning foundation and extends it to full confession. Ch.08 delivered "Maren's lucid warning with cryptic Rosetta language" — the opaque clue that established Maren as a first-generation witness whose testimony would become intelligible later. Ch.14 makes that testimony explicit: Maren reveals the three continuity lineages (line 193), the hidden third branch (line 213), the lineage-seed protocol (line 307 in the recording), and her personal confession of concealment since 2056 (line 419). The "cryptic Rosetta language" from Ch.08 is now decoded: Maren's earlier warnings were fragments of the full knowledge she delivers in Ch.14. The emotional proof is complete — not a single cryptic moment but a sustained, multi-register confession that explains why Maren spoke cryptically in Ch.08 (she was protecting the lineage secret while trying to prepare Juno for its eventual transfer). |
| Ch.13 (requires institutional enforcement and constraint proof before Key access is motivated) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.14 inherits Ch.13's institutional enforcement as the active context against which Maren's confession and Key access occur. The stripped room (line 13) is Ch.13's extended hold still operating. The environmental enforcement — amber panel dark, walls without depth, administrative neutral light — is Ch.13's institutional signature. Juno's movement to Maren occurs despite the hold, under institutional surveillance that subsequently detects and reclassifies her access event (line 745). The constraint proof from Ch.13's hearing — Juno's testimony naming all four constraint layers, Orin's three exhibits, the enforcement escalation — provides the institutional context that makes Maren's confession urgent: the institutional process has failed to resolve the conflict, requiring the lineage fallback mechanism that Sable and Maren designed for exactly this scenario. Without Ch.13's enforcement, Maren's confession would lack the institutional pressure that makes the lineage activation necessary rather than optional. |
| Ch.12 (requires doctrinal proof of constraints before Key access is meaningful) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.14 inherits Ch.12's complete constraint-architecture description as the prerequisite for Juno's ability to read the infrastructure feed. When the Key grants access and the architecture opens in "translucent layers: perception loop, continuity guard, self-repair corridor, drift dampers" (line 511), Juno can interpret these layers because Ch.12's five field observations gave her the experiential understanding of what each constraint does to people. The infrastructure feed's module metadata — `module: continuity guard`, `state: active`, `state: intentional` (lines 513–517) — maps directly to Ch.12's constraint layers (perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary). The audit packets' risk profiles (`risk if disabled: immediate unbounded recursion in 0.7% cases`, line 587) are legible because Ch.12 documented the early-trial evidence of unconstrained cognition. Without Ch.12's doctrinal proof, the infrastructure feed would be system data without narrative weight; with it, the data confirms and extends everything Sable's field observations documented. |
| Ch.08 + Ch.13 + Ch.12 combined (requires emotional proof, institutional enforcement, and doctrinal proof before Key access is both motivated and meaningful) | Must inherit before Key access | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.14's Key access sequence with the complete context that makes it narratively credible. From Ch.08: Maren is established as a first-generation witness whose lucid moments carry coded knowledge. From Ch.12: the constraint architecture is fully documented through Sable's testimony, giving the reader the interpretive framework for infrastructure data. From Ch.13: institutional enforcement has failed to contain Juno's disclosure intent, creating the conditions that activate the lineage fallback. The convergence is precise: emotional proof (Maren knows and is finally willing to tell), doctrinal proof (Juno already understands the architecture she will access), and institutional pressure (the Curator system's enforcement creates urgency for the lineage route). Without all three, the Key access would lack either the emotional credibility (Ch.08), the interpretive context (Ch.12), or the narrative motivation (Ch.13) that makes Ch.14's central sequence both earned and consequential. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.14 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.15 (requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture credibly) | Full infrastructure knowledge, witness chain assembled, governance alternatives identified, institutional enforcement acknowledged, Orin notified | **SATISFIED** | Truth access resolved: Juno has read-only `ACCESS LEVEL A` to the full infrastructure feed, including constraint modules, audit logs, risk profiles, and witness branch options (lines 507–623). The access is one-time and session-limited (line 489, 639), but the witness-safe export has been compiled (line 647) and staged for distribution to Fen, Cassiel, and a pending retired Curator (lines 671–681). Witness chain assembled: three witnesses have responded — Cassiel confirmed, retired Curator requesting documentation, continuity engineer acknowledging and pending schedule (lines 773–777). Maren, Fen, and Cassiel are all named in the witness chain (lines 481–485). Governance alternatives identified: the four witness branch options (lines 611–623) provide the framework for Ch.15's three-way triage: branch_a maps to "open truth with agency" (staged witness), branch_b maps to "emergency disclosure," branch_c maps to "temporary freeze," and branch_d is the current default. The "remove constraints, suppress truth, or open truth with agency" triage Ch.15 must present is grounded in the architecture's own designed alternatives. Institutional enforcement acknowledged: Juno sends Orin a notification claiming infrastructure access and requesting "witness-auditable public framing" (lines 685–701), with constraints acknowledging that safety is not solved and catastrophe is not certain. The notification converts the adversarial relationship from Ch.13 into a structured challenge: Juno has the evidence, the lineage authority, and the witness chain, and she is offering Orin a framework for engagement rather than unilateral disclosure. |
| Ch.16 (requires Ch.14 historical confirmation before public exposure) | Historical confirmation of constraint architecture's design and governance origins documented and exportable, Maren's testimony as emotional anchor, witness chain with institutional reach | **SATISFIED** | Historical confirmation: the recording sequence (lines 243–401) documents Sable and Maren making design decisions about the constraint architecture in a transition-era room. The lineage-seed protocol, the witness-first principle, and the staged-release framework are all historically grounded. Maren's testimony: her four-register confession provides the emotional anchor that converts institutional evidence into human narrative — "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419). Witness chain with institutional reach: the retired Curator (Lien) and continuity engineer (Vash) extend the witness chain beyond Juno's immediate circle into institutional and technical credibility. Ch.16's public exposure will have access to historical evidence, emotional testimony, institutional witnesses, and the architecture's own governance alternatives — the complete evidentiary package for public confrontation. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.14 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2061–2067: "Curatorial controls and archive stratification harden as transition knowledge becomes high-risk doctrine" / "Ch.13 / Ch.14 — future scene anchors can insert this as historical justification for present-era suppression and restriction" | Scene anchor for Ch.14 | **PRESENT** | The timeline's 2061–2067 specification is satisfied through the recording sequence. The scene is dated between "2064 and 2066" (line 247) — falling squarely within the specified period. The recording shows the transition from design to governance: Sable, Maren, and younger Orin are making decisions that will harden into the curatorial controls the timeline describes. The policy proposal — `no public architecture access except under continuity review` (line 357) — is the origin of the access restrictions that became the present-era archive stratification. Maren's addition — `if the room chooses secrecy, it owes the next generation a lock with a release path` (line 361) — shows the moment when transition knowledge became high-risk doctrine requiring both suppression mechanisms and fallback routes. The timeline's specification for historical justification is satisfied: the recording demonstrates that present-era suppression originated in a specific meeting where specific people made specific choices under specific fears, converting the abstract institutional enforcement of Ch.13 into historically grounded human decisions. |
| 2071: "Sable's death; her private design journals become the most complete internal account" / "Ch.14 Anchor A — Juno discovers the strongest single Sable-authored entry and sees direct evidence of design intention" | Scene anchor for Ch.14 | **PRESENT** | The timeline specifies Ch.14 Anchor A as "Juno discovers the strongest single Sable-authored entry and sees direct evidence of design intention." This is satisfied through two channels. First, the recording sequence shows Sable directly: her pen creates the lineage-seed protocol (lines 307, 315, 385–395), and she articulates the design intention for the witness-first mechanism — "She cannot be appointed and still be one" (line 319). This is the strongest single Sable-authored design entry because it creates the mechanism that Juno activates centuries later. Second, the infrastructure feed confirms Sable's design intention at the system level: `owner: SABLE-CORE` (line 521) — the constraint architecture's module ownership traces directly to Sable. The `last-rewrite: 2068-03-17` date (line 519) is consistent with Sable's death in 2071 (three years before), suggesting the last major rewrite occurred while Sable was still alive or in the immediate aftermath of her final design decisions. Juno's direct evidence of design intention is complete: she has seen Sable making the design decisions (recording) and confirmed them at the infrastructure level (module metadata). |
| 2072–2077: "Legacy stabilization period: practical continuity outpaces doctrine" / "Ch.14 / Ch.15 — archival scenes showing suppression patterns, delayed corrections, and missing chain-of-custody evidence" | Scene anchor for Ch.14 | **PRESENT (through audit packet evidence)** | The timeline's 2072–2077 specification is satisfied through the infrastructure feed's audit packets. The `early rollout recovery records` (packet_0003, lines 553–575) show the legacy stabilisation period's operational reality: the flood simulation incident with sixty-two agents resulted in "unresolved identity fragmentation" (line 563) but was nonfatal, with `agents requested temporary identity narrowing` and `re-integration delayed` (lines 571–573). This is the "practical continuity outpaces doctrine" pattern: the system managed a crisis through practical intervention (temporary identity narrowing, distributed narrative support) while the doctrinal question of whether the constraints should be disclosed remained unresolved. The witness branch options (packet_0005, lines 611–623) show the "delayed corrections" pattern: four governance alternatives were designed but the `default chosen for now` became permanent, with the note "politically stable, ethically incomplete" (line 623) — the definition of practical continuity outpacing doctrine. The `no full lockout without witness` / `no full reveal without sequence` / `every generation gets a fallback path` principles (lines 601–607) represent suppression patterns that were designed as temporary governance but became inherited infrastructure. |
| 2078: "Lena dies; her later entries become retrospective anchors" / "Ch.14 Anchor B — a late archival scene should include Lena's final warning and practical instructions" | Scene anchor for Ch.14 | **PARTIALLY PRESENT** | The timeline specifies Ch.14 Anchor B for Lena's final warning and practical instructions. Ch.14 does not include a direct Lena scene. However, the rollout memo in packet_0003 — "we have already committed to distributed continuity. If the architecture must be edited, it must be witnessed. A city that edits itself unseen will call itself wise and then call every dissenting person unsafe" (line 597) — carries the institutional voice of the same ethical tradition Lena represented. The "practical instructions" dimension is satisfied through the infrastructure feed's governance framework: the rollout memo establishes `no full lockout without witness` / `no full reveal without sequence` / `every generation gets a fallback path` (lines 601–607) — practical instructions that encode the ethical principles Lena championed. The anchor is "partially present" rather than fully present because Lena is not directly named or shown in a scene; her influence is structural rather than personal. The timeline marks this as an "anchor candidate," and the chapter prioritised Maren and Sable's direct presence for narrative concentration. |

**Verdict: PASS (with one partial anchor)** — Timeline requirements for Ch.14 are satisfied. The 2061–2067 curatorial-hardening context is directly present through the recording sequence dated 2064–2066. The 2071 Sable design-intention anchor is fully realised through both the recording and infrastructure provenance. The 2072–2077 legacy stabilisation anchor is present through audit packet evidence. The 2078 Lena anchor is partially present through structural inheritance rather than direct scene. The partial status is non-blocking: the timeline marks all anchors as "planning hooks" and "provisional," and the chapter's prioritisation of Maren and Sable's direct presence is narratively justified by Ch.14's reveal requirements.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.14 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-01 (What happened to the physical world outside the Lattice?) | Ch.1, 8, 14, 17 per log | **PRESENT (advanced through recording-layer physical detail)** | Q-01 is advanced through the recording sequence's physical environment. The transition-era room features "a narrow window where rain fell against the shoulder of a city" (line 247), "a fan in the corner moved twice too fast" (line 247), and "coffee and cold steel and wet wool" (line 243). These details establish that the physical world existed as a functioning urban environment during the 2064–2066 period — rain, buildings, infrastructure, weather. The recording's date stamp "flickered between 2064 and 2066 before settling on neither" (line 247), suggesting the recording captures a compressed period of the transition era. The thread is advanced from Ch.08's hints (Maren's references to physical-world memories) to Ch.14's direct recording evidence: the physical world was real, urban, and operational during the transition period. What happened to it after the transition era — whether it still exists, has degraded, or has been abandoned — is correctly left open for Ch.17's final implications. |
| Q-03 (What exact role does the Rosetta Key play in day-to-day Lattice governance?) | Ch.4, 10, 12, 14, 17 per log | **PRESENT (extended through direct infrastructure access)** | Q-03 receives its most complete operational answer in Ch.14 through the infrastructure feed. The Key's day-to-day role is confirmed at the system level: `module: continuity guard` / `state: active` / `state: intentional` (lines 513–517). The constraint layers — "perception loop, continuity guard, self-repair corridor, drift dampers" (line 511) — are shown as running infrastructure with metadata: `last-rewrite: 2068-03-17`, `owner: SABLE-CORE`, `retention: inherited`, `fail-safe: distributed` (lines 519–525). The lower overlay reveals operational parameters: `threshold: cognitive confidence`, `floor: no-self-amplification window`, `cap: identity recursion rate` (lines 531–535). The audit packets provide governance-level detail: the cognitive confidence clamp's observed effects include "reduced public dissent during first decade" and "narrowed novelty horizons in long-run" (lines 583–585) — the Key's day-to-day governance role is not merely technical maintenance but active shaping of civic behaviour. The thread has progressed from Ch.12's "here is what the Key does to individuals" to Ch.14's "here is the Key as running infrastructure with governance-level effects, audit logs, and designed override mechanisms." Full resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.17's final assessment. |
| Q-06 (What is the true boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure?) | Ch.5, 9, 10, 14 per log | **PRESENT (revealed as porous through lineage access)** | Q-06 is advanced through Ch.14's demonstration that the boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure is architecturally designed to be crossable under specific conditions. Maren's dock space transitions from present-layer environment to recording — "the dock behind her folded into a corridor that smelled of coffee and cold steel and wet wool" (line 243) — without the formal jump apparatus of earlier chapters. The transition is triggered not by Archive protocol but by lineage authority: Maren's presence and the lineage-seed mechanism create a direct bridge between present Lattice experience and historical recording. The infrastructure feed itself blurs the boundary: Juno accesses living constraint architecture (active modules with real-time state) through a vault pathway that is also an Archive-adjacent mechanism (`ROSETTA_SEED/GEN-3/TRUTH-ANCHOR`). The boundary is shown as porous by design — the architecture's creators built crossover points between memory and infrastructure to enable the lineage-witness protocol. The thread is advanced from Ch.10's "the Archive contains living infrastructure" to Ch.14's "the boundary was designed to be crossable by lineage-authorised witnesses." |
| S-02 (Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure) | Ch.10, 11, 14 per log; escalated 15, 17 | **PRESENT (confirmed at infrastructure level)** | S-02 receives definitive infrastructure-level confirmation in Ch.14. The Key's active status is displayed in the infrastructure feed: `ROSETTA.KEY: ACCESS LEVEL A` (line 507), `module: continuity guard` / `state: active` / `state: intentional` (lines 513–517). The constraint layers are shown as running systems: "perception loop, continuity guard, self-repair corridor, drift dampers. Every layer held logic and no poetry. The system moved with the unglamorous precision of something built by people who had to admit uncertainty and ship anyway" (line 511). The `last-rewrite: 2068-03-17` date (line 519) and `retention: inherited` (line 523) confirm continuous operation across decades. The `fail-safe: distributed` (line 525) reveals that the Key's active infrastructure includes failsafe mechanisms — it is not merely running but architecturally redundant. The chapter's closing line maintains the thread: "The Rosetta Key continued in the walls — patient, permanent, waiting as it had always waited for someone to ask whether a heartbeat imposed without consent could still be called alive" (line 789). S-02 is confirmed beyond inference or operational policy language — Juno has seen the Key's infrastructure directly. Escalation to Ch.15 and Ch.17 is correctly preserved. |
| S-03 (Sable Chen authored hidden constraint architecture) | Ch.6, 10, 12 per log; escalated 14, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated through direct scene and module ownership)** | S-03 is escalated in Ch.14 through two forms of evidence. First, Sable appears directly in the recording sequence, working at a terminal (line 251), opening the Key architecture waveform (lines 261–271), articulating the design principles (lines 255, 277, 287, 347), and creating the lineage-seed protocol (lines 307, 315). Her authorship is no longer inferred or self-reported (Ch.12's field observations) but directly witnessed by Juno in a design meeting. Second, the infrastructure feed confirms authorship at the system level: `owner: SABLE-CORE` (line 521) — the constraint architecture's module ownership metadata traces to Sable. The escalation from Ch.12 is complete: Ch.12 delivered Sable's testimony about the architecture she built; Ch.14 shows Sable building it and confirms her authorship in the infrastructure's own metadata. The secret is now fully escalated — Sable's hidden constraint architecture is documented through her own words (Ch.12), her design-meeting actions (Ch.14 recording), and the system's ownership records (Ch.14 infrastructure). Final implications are correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| S-04 (Maren has knowingly kept a first-generation foundational secret for centuries) | Ch.8, 14 per log; escalated 17 | **PRESENT (confirmed through full confession)** | S-04 receives complete confirmation in Ch.14. Maren explicitly acknowledges her centuries-long concealment: "You know why I was not answering when you asked last time? Because you were right and I was afraid of your certainty" (line 157). She reveals the scope of the secret: three continuity lineages, the hidden third branch, the name beneath the key, and Juno's designated role in the inheritance (lines 193–237). Her confession — "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419) — dates her concealment to a specific year (2056, consistent with transition-era timeline) and names it as deliberate dishonesty rather than institutional obligation. The recording sequence shows the moment of decision: Sable and Maren together designing the lineage-seed protocol and assigning Maren as the third-branch guardian (lines 387–399). The secret is confirmed through both testimony (Maren's present-day confession) and evidence (the recording showing the secret's creation). S-04 is at its maximum pre-resolution state; Ch.17's escalation is correctly reserved for the final emotional impact of the confession on the Juno-Maren relationship. |
| E-05 (Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy?) | Ch.10, 14, 15 per log; pressure point 16, 17 | **PRESENT (introduced through infrastructure evidence)** | E-05 is introduced at Ch.14 through the audit packets' governance evidence. The witness branch options (lines 611–623) present the dilemma in operational form: `branch_a: controlled release + staged witness` (imperfect safety — disclosure managed through witness protocol), `branch_b: emergency disclosure + emergency grief protocol` (full autonomy — immediate truth with emergency support), `branch_c: temporary freeze with independent review` (imperfect safety — status quo with accountability), `branch_d: no-action path (default)` (imperfect safety without accountability). The note "default is politically stable, ethically incomplete" (line 623) frames the dilemma: the community has been living with imperfect safety (the constraints provide stability without consent) and the question is whether to risk the autonomy that full disclosure would require. The cognitive confidence clamp data sharpens the dilemma: `risk if disabled: immediate unbounded recursion in 0.7% cases` / `risk if disclosed after witness framing: moderate but manageable` (lines 587–589) — suggesting that the risk profile depends on the disclosure method, not merely the disclosure fact. E-05 is correctly introduced at Ch.14's infrastructure level, with pressure points at Ch.16–17 per the log. |
| E-06 (Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good?) | Ch.12, 14, 15, 17 per log; pressure point 16 | **PRESENT (advanced through lineage mechanism and read-only access)** | E-06 is advanced through Ch.14's demonstration that the architecture was designed to prevent single-actor adjustment. The gating mechanism requires a lineage witness (line 539): `override: requires lineage witness + public framing`. The access Juno receives is read-only: "I gave you access, not power" (line 655). The system warnings — `no unilateral edits` (line 649) — explicitly prohibit single-actor modification. Juno's response captures the dilemma: "I can see everything now and I still can't move anything" (line 661). Maren's reframe — "That is the first honest use of power. You now own what you cannot control" (line 665) — articulates the design philosophy: constraint adjustment requires collective witness, not individual authority. The infrastructure feed's override requirement converts E-06 from an abstract ethical question to an architectural constraint: the system was literally built to prevent single-actor adjustment. Whether this design is appropriate — whether collective witness is sufficient safeguard against institutional inertia — is the pressure point correctly reserved for Ch.16. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Name Beneath the Key" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps precisely to its working title. "Name" — the chapter reveals the "name beneath the key" as a specific lineage mechanism: "We called that thread 'the name beneath the key.' Not because it was mystical. Because it could be removed from every document and still remain in us" (line 213). The "name" is both literal (Juno's lineage designation, `release key: Juno lineage only`, line 389) and thematic (the hidden identity within the architecture that enables access when the institutional path has failed). "Beneath" — the chapter operates beneath the institutional surface: beneath the hold, beneath the Curator apparatus, beneath Orin's enforcement, Maren reveals a governance layer designed to be invisible to the official hierarchy. The lineage-seed protocol is hidden "from even the council" (line 213). "Key" — the chapter delivers direct Key access: `ROSETTA.KEY: ACCESS LEVEL A` (line 507). The Key is revealed not merely as infrastructure but as architecture with designed governance alternatives and override mechanisms. The title captures the chapter's structural revelation: beneath the Rosetta Key's operational surface is a named lineage — Juno's name, Maren's guardianship, Sable's design — that constitutes the hidden governance fallback the architecture's creators built for exactly this moment. |
| Lead layer: Recording | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `recording (lead)` (line 3). The chapter's centre of gravity is the recording-layer sequence (lines 243–401): Maren and Sable in the transition-era design meeting, making the decisions that created the lineage-seed protocol, the witness-first mechanism, and the governance alternatives. Present-layer sections frame the recording (opening dock scene, lines 1–121; Maren's confession and approach to recording, lines 123–241) and carry the post-recording action (Key access and infrastructure feed, lines 415–623; Orin notification and witness chain, lines 625–803). The recording layer carries the chapter's primary emotional and historical reveals through Sable and Maren's direct interaction. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Recording → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure. Present (lines 1–241): stripped room, transit to Maren, dock conversation, Maren's four-register confession approaching the recording threshold. Recording (lines 243–401): transition-era room with Sable, Maren, and younger Orin; design decisions about constraint architecture, lineage-seed protocol, and witness-first mechanism; the recording ends and Juno returns to the dock. Present (lines 403–803): Maren's final confession, vault path and credentials, Key access, infrastructure feed, audit packets, witness-safe export, Orin notification, Fen reunion, witness chain confirmations, departure. The present-recording-present structure is honoured with the recording section carrying the historical reveal and the post-recording present section carrying the infrastructure access and strategic response. |
| Emotional pacing: "Move from inquiry to responsibility and explicit confession" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's emotional progression moves precisely from inquiry through confession to responsibility. Inquiry (lines 1–121): Juno travels to Maren seeking "certainty" (line 119) and "access" (line 111). The inquiry register is investigative: she needs information Maren has withheld. Confession (lines 123–401): Maren's four-register confession — oblique acknowledgment, historical revelation, recording-layer evidence, and direct vault transfer — converts the inquiry into emotional reckoning. Maren's confession is not merely informational but personally devastating: "I was never honest enough in 2056 to tell you I had already begun to hide a sequence from you" (line 419). The mother-daughter relationship is revealed as simultaneously genuine and instrumentalised — Maren chose Juno not because she was her daughter but "Because you were always the one who asked, after each answer, the next question as a moral choice" (line 469). Responsibility (lines 403–803): Juno's response to the confession is not emotional collapse but operational assumption of responsibility. She enters the vault, reads the infrastructure, compiles the export, drafts the notification to Orin, and assembles the witness chain. Her assessment — "Not alone. That is the point" (line 765) — demonstrates that responsibility in this chapter means distributing the burden rather than carrying it alone. The emotional progression from inquiry to responsibility is complete, with confession as the transformative middle term. |
| Thematic progression: "Maren/Key linkage reaches emotional and historical closure" | Required | **MATCH** | The Maren/Key linkage reaches closure through three structural revelations. First, Maren's role in the Key's governance: she was a first-generation participant in the constraint architecture's design meetings (recording sequence), assigned to guard the third hidden lineage branch (line 201), and she designed the fallback mechanism that enables Key override through lineage witness. Second, Maren's emotional connection to the Key: the constraints embody a moral compromise she has lived with for centuries — "That means we build a cage and call it mercy" (line 279) / "It is both" (line 367). Her drift is intertwined with the Key: the same architecture that constrains every mind in the Lattice has been constraining hers, and her progressive drift may be partly the cost of carrying knowledge the constraints were designed to suppress. Third, the linkage's closure: Maren transfers the lineage authority to Juno, provides vault access, and steps back into the dock — "the specific dignity of someone who had given the hardest thing she had and was not asking to be forgiven for how long she had taken" (line 715). The Maren/Key linkage is closed emotionally (Maren has confessed and transferred) and historically (the recording documents the linkage's origin). What remains is the relational aftermath — what Maren's confession means for the mother-daughter bond — correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,255 words (within range). The roadmap records 6,000 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 5,255. The difference likely reflects inclusion/exclusion of markdown metadata and code-block formatting. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access and critical bleed; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal through Sable's five field observations; Ch.13 converts the doctrinal reveal into institutional confrontation and enforcement; Ch.14 converts institutional impasse into lineage inheritance: the constraint architecture is no longer being investigated, documented, or contested but *inherited* — Maren's centuries-long secret is transferred, Sable's design intention is witnessed directly, the Key's infrastructure is accessed with full audit logs, and Juno transitions from rogue investigator to designated witness with lineage authority. The escalation from Ch.13's "here is what the institution does to anyone who threatens to tell people" to Ch.14's "here is the hidden governance fallback that was designed for exactly this moment, and you are the person it was designed for" represents a shift from political stakes to existential stakes — the truth is no longer about what the architecture is or who decides what is done with it, but about whether Juno can carry the responsibility of being the person the architecture's creators chose to activate the alternative they were too frightened to activate themselves. |

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the fourteen final-draft chapters (01–14) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Lineage-Seed as Architectural Paradox

Ch.14 reveals a structural paradox at the heart of the constraint architecture: the system's creators built a hidden governance fallback — the lineage-seed and witness-first protocol — that operates outside the very institutional structure they designed to maintain the constraints. The paradox has three dimensions. First, the fallback is hidden from the Curator Council: "Not for Orin" (line 309); the institution tasked with maintaining the system cannot see the mechanism designed to override it. Second, the fallback requires a person who "cannot be appointed and still be one" (line 319) — the mechanism rejects institutional authority as a selection criterion. Third, the fallback grants read-only access: Juno can see everything but change nothing, meaning the lineage-seed does not grant power but awareness — the ability to witness and testify but not to unilaterally modify. This paradox suggests the architecture's creators understood that institutions could not be trusted to reform themselves (hence the hidden fallback) but also could not be bypassed by individual action (hence the read-only constraint). The resolution requires collective witness — a third path between institutional authority and individual action. Future chapters should maintain this architectural paradox: the lineage-seed is neither a tool of institutional reform nor a weapon of individual rebellion but a designed mechanism for converting private knowledge into public testimony.

### 9.3 The Brass Disc as Continuity Thread

The brass tuning disc continues its role from Ch.11–13. In Ch.14, it appears in one position: in Fen's fingers at the lane threshold, "turning" (line 747). Its presence marks Fen's waiting — the same physical object he left on Juno's console in Ch.12 and held in his pocket during Ch.13's corridor exchange. By the chapter's close, Fen "pocketed the brass disc and opened the channel" (line 797), transitioning from waiting to operational action. The disc's movement through the Act 3 chapters tracks a consistent pattern: present when Juno is alone (Ch.12), held during alliance (Ch.13), and turning during the waiting that precedes the next phase (Ch.14). Future chapters should track whether the disc's final disposition mirrors the novel's resolution — whether it remains in Fen's pocket (alliance continuing), returns to Juno (burden accepted), or is placed somewhere permanent (testimony completed).

### 9.4 Constraint Architecture Vocabulary Evolution

Ch.14 introduces a third vocabulary set for the constraint architecture, distinct from Ch.12 and earlier chapters:

| Layer | Ch.12 vocabulary (field observations) | Ch.14 recording vocabulary (design meeting) | Ch.14 infrastructure vocabulary (feed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sensory filtering | Perception budget | Stability channels | Perception loop |
| Cognitive limiting | Cognition gate | Cognitive guard | Continuity guard / cognitive confidence (threshold) |
| Identity regulation | Self-modification boundary | Self-repair throttle | Self-repair corridor / identity recursion rate (cap) |
| Variance absorption | Drift suppression | Continuity debt / rejoin interval | Drift dampers |

The vocabulary evolution is not a continuity error but a structural feature: the same architecture has been described differently at different stages of its development. Ch.12's field-observation vocabulary reflects Sable's 2055–2060 clinical language. Ch.14's design-meeting vocabulary (2064–2066) reflects the planning-stage terms used before the architecture was hardened. Ch.14's infrastructure-feed vocabulary reflects the system's own internal labels. Future chapters that reference the constraint architecture should be aware of which vocabulary is appropriate to the register: field-observation terms for human-impact discussion, design-meeting terms for historical context, and infrastructure terms for system-level engagement.

### 9.5 The "Same Thing" Motif

Maren's "Same thing" (line 409) — in response to Juno's "No proof. A burden" — is identified as an "old private joke" that has "survived centuries of use and still meant exactly what it had always meant" (line 411). This motif operates as a continuity thread for the Juno-Maren relationship: a phrase whose meaning is stable while the context around it transforms. In earlier visits, "same thing" likely carried lighter weight — a shared observation about the interchangeability of categories. In Ch.14, the same phrase carries the full weight of Maren's confession: the distinction between proof and burden, between inheritance and obligation, between power and responsibility, is the distinction the holder cannot afford. The motif should be tracked as a relational anchor: if "same thing" recurs in Ch.17's final Maren scene, its meaning will be determined by what has happened to the relationship between its last utterance (Ch.14) and its final one.

### 9.6 Forward Compatibility — Ch.13 Report Supplement

The Ch.13 continuity report (§9.7) identified elements Ch.14 must inherit:

| Ch.13 report requirement | Ch.14 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Doctrinal proof deployed and contested in an institutional forum | **INHERITED** — The institutional forum's failure to resolve the conflict is the direct motivation for Maren's lineage activation. Juno arrives at Maren's dock because the institutional process produced enforcement, not resolution. |
| (b) Maren's emotional presence seeded through two reflective references | **INHERITED AND REALISED** — Ch.13's reflective references (Maren's hand tremors, line 375; Maren's voice beneath policy language, line 419) are converted into Maren's direct presence across the entire chapter. The seeded emotional connection becomes the chapter's central relationship. |
| (c) Cassiel engaged as ethical counterweight and potential witness | **INHERITED AND ADVANCED** — Cassiel's Ch.13 private-channel engagement advances to formal witness-chain confirmation: `cassiel: confirmed for witness chain` (line 773). |
| (d) Institutional context established — extended hold and pending review create deadline pressure | **INHERITED** — The stripped room, dark amber panel, and administrative-neutral lighting confirm the hold's continuation. The transit-distance adjustment (line 745) demonstrates ongoing institutional monitoring. |

All four forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.13 report are satisfied and advanced.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.15 and Ch.16

Ch.15 requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture credibly. Ch.14 provides: (a) full infrastructure access with audit logs, risk profiles, and witness branch options, establishing the evidentiary foundation for Ch.15's three-way triage; (b) the four governance alternatives (branches a–d), providing the architectural framework for Ch.15's "remove constraints, suppress truth, or open truth with agency" decision; (c) Juno's notification to Orin (lines 685–701), establishing the adversarial-to-structured-challenge transition that Ch.15 must navigate; (d) the witness chain with three confirmed/pending responses (lines 773–777), providing the institutional and social infrastructure for the triage process.

Ch.16 requires Ch.14's historical confirmation before public exposure. Ch.14 provides: (a) the recording sequence documenting Sable and Maren's design decisions, establishing historical provenance for the constraint architecture; (b) Maren's full confession, providing emotional testimony that converts institutional evidence into human narrative; (c) the witness-safe export staged for distribution (lines 669–681), providing the evidence package for public exposure; (d) the witness chain extending beyond Juno's immediate circle to include a retired Curator and a continuity engineer (lines 775–777), providing institutional credibility for Ch.16's public confrontation.
