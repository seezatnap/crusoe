## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-11.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-11.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 11 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Rogue jumps and explicit severe bleed risks | **PRESENT** | Ch.11's entire narrative structure is built around Juno's decision to undertake rogue access into degraded recording clusters. The chapter opens with fourteen hours of post-Ch.10 processing (line 5), during which Juno has been contemplating "the next step" — deep access into "restricted, degraded recording clusters that the system had flagged as unsafe" (line 33). The session is labelled explicitly: `session label: rogue-access`, `approval: none`, `risk flag: immediate` (lines 127–131). The deep-channel target reads `status: restricted/degraded`, `policy: redline`, with integrity at 28% (lines 72–78, 145). Bleed escalates through five discrete increments: +0.7 (line 209), +1.4 (line 259), +2.1 (line 293), +2.1 again (line 323), reaching `critical` status (line 343) with an identity drift warning (line 351). The emergency panel shifts from amber to active review (lines 437–445, 495). The rogue jump is not implied or metaphorical — it is operationally executed, system-logged, and consequentially irreversible. |
| Reveal status: "Public" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers public-level revelation through two mechanisms. First, the rogue access is explicitly logged and system-acknowledged: the unauthorized deep access triggers an alert (`alert: unauthorized deep access`, `origin: agent`, `origin-id: sable-lattice-shadow`, `status: under review`, lines 439–445). Second, Juno's message to Orin explicitly declares the access: "I completed deep access. If this is disobedience, then call it done" and "if you need my silence, it is now a choice you no longer own" (lines 389–397). The act is no longer private — it is institutionally visible, personally declared, and system-recorded. The reveal is public in the narrative sense: Juno's rogue behaviour is now a matter of institutional record, and her possession of Sable's degraded-cluster evidence is no longer concealable. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.11 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the irreversible-escalation chapter described in the matrix, forcing rogue-jump cost decisions and severe bleed consequences into the public institutional record.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She chooses rogue jump behavior and accepts overt risk | **PRESENT (primary)** | Ch.11 is defined by Juno's deliberate choice to enter rogue access. She spends fourteen hours weighing the decision (lines 5–37), identifies the deep-channel target (`vestige-echo`, restricted/degraded, redline policy, lines 71–78), and acknowledges that "what she was considering was the operational definition of self-harm" (line 35). She sets the session parameters: `rogue-access`, `approval: none`, `risk flag: immediate` (lines 127–131). She presses yes on a 28% integrity jump (line 151). She continues through four degraded recording files despite escalating bleed (+0.7, +1.4, +2.1, +2.1, critical), and when the emergency monitor tells her to "stop immediately" (line 355), she prioritises extraction over safety: "She did not argue. She opened the mirror manifests and began copying every fragment to three locations" (line 361). The choice is overt, deliberate, and accepted with full awareness of consequence. |
| Emotional and cognitive costs are explicit and no longer recoverable as "just exhaustion" | **PRESENT** | The costs of the rogue jump manifest across four registers. Physical: her left hand shakes "at the same rhythm as the ventilation" (line 375), she experiences metallic taste (line 417), and a headache "where her temple lines met the old ache of sustained focus" (line 417). Cognitive: syntax arrives in her mouth "half a beat late, edited by something that was not her" (line 418). Perceptual: degraded recordings produce false sensory fills — "faint wetness under her fingertips, the texture of touching old metal" (line 177), overlapping timelines fracturing single recordings into parallel streams (lines 195, 219, 227). Bleed markers escalate from acute (inherited from Ch.10) through five increments to critical (line 343) with identity drift warning (line 351). The costs are explicitly labelled as no longer reversible: "You are not leaving this room the same person who entered it" (Fen, line 421) and "the bleed had settled into her motor system — not a crisis, but a statement from the architecture that what she had done would not be undone by closing a panel" (line 375). These are not symptoms of exhaustion — they are documented, system-logged consequences of deliberate rogue access. |
| Obsession shown at correct Act 3 intensity | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's Act 3 obsession has matured from Ch.10's investigative compulsion into operational commitment. She has not eaten, has slept only in "reduced-attention mode" (line 13), has ignored three messages from Fen (line 13), and has answered Cassiel with only "I am working" (line 13). Her justification for the rogue jump is precise and strategic: "The journals gave us the design. The degraded clusters have the implementation — the actual moments when the constraints were tested, argued over, and hardened into permanent infrastructure" (line 113). She is not spiralling — she is making a calculated decision that she acknowledges as self-harm. The distinction between compulsive obsession and deliberate risk-acceptance is correctly maintained: "She opened the deep-channel routing map and felt nothing she could name as courage" (line 37). |
| Risk: obsession shown too early (Act 2 concern) | **NO VIOLATION** | The rogue-jump behaviour is correctly reserved for Act 3. Ch.10's report confirmed that Juno's obsession in Act 2 was "visible but strategic" and that "rogue-jump behaviour reserved for Act 3 (Ch.11) has not been triggered." Ch.11 delivers the rogue jump at its correct narrative position — the first chapter of Act 3 — with full escalation from Ch.10's controlled investigation to Ch.11's unauthorized deep access. The escalation is sequential and earned through ten chapters of progressive intensification. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit gatekeeper and enforcer; moves from persuasion to operational containment | **PRESENT (initiated)** | Orin's presence in Ch.11 operates through two institutional mechanisms. First, the recovery notice: "Orin sent a recovery notice at first bell. Your name was on it" (line 55), with the message `please hold current archive actions until review` (line 61). Fen interprets: "Hold from Orin is stop wearing a different coat" (line 67). The notice represents Orin's attempt to reassert containment after Ch.10's maintenance-layer discovery. Second, Juno's post-access message to Orin (lines 385–397): "I completed deep access. If this is disobedience, then call it done... if you need my silence, it is now a choice you no longer own." This message directly challenges Orin's containment authority by declaring the investigation's irreversibility. The system's alert (`unauthorized deep access`, `status: under review`, lines 439–445) suggests institutional response is imminent. Orin's transition from persuasion (Ch.03–09) through policy containment (Ch.09) to operational enforcement is correctly initiated — the recovery notice represents the first institutional action, and the unauthorized-access alert sets up explicit enforcement for Ch.13. |
| No overexposure of intentions before evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin does not appear directly in Ch.11. His presence is mediated through institutional mechanisms (recovery notice, system alert) and Juno's characterisation. Juno's understanding of what Orin was protecting — "That is what Orin was protecting" (line 11) — is based on Ch.10's evidence (process-handle query, journal acquisition), not on Orin's self-disclosure. His motives remain structurally ambiguous: the recovery notice can be read as protective caution ("hold until review") or as containment strategy ("stop wearing a different coat"). The ambiguity is correctly preserved through institutional language. |

### 2.3 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fully allied with Juno's high-risk phase, while retaining practical fears and questions | **PRESENT (major)** | Fen undergoes the definitive Act 3 transition in Ch.11 — from operational partner (Ch.10) to active accomplice in rogue access. He arrives uninvited (line 41) with "printer ink still on his fingers from a job he had not finished" (line 43), indicating he interrupted his own work to check on Juno. He immediately reads the situation: console, routing map, bleed markers (line 43). His practical fears are explicit: "You are a person whose bleed markers are acute. Whose anchor-drift is moderate. Whose last four cycles of rest have been pretending" (line 97). He names the danger of the deep channel: "Sable used degradation as camouflage. That does not make the degradation safe" (line 89). But his alliance overrides his fear: "Then I stand by until it is done. Four-minute check-ins. If you miss one, I pull you out" (line 117). When Juno protests his lack of override authority, he responds: "I have hands and I have the emergency disconnect. Authority is an administrative concept and I am your friend" (line 121). He monitors throughout the jump (lines 263–265), stands behind Juno with his hand on the emergency disconnect when markers hit critical (line 345), allows the extraction to complete (line 383), and remains at the pod entrance after (line 483). His final commitment: note-taking for continuity verification (line 489). Alliance is complete; practical fears are retained through his description of the situation as "Not good. But clear" (line 451). |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's alliance in Ch.11 follows a ten-chapter progression: external observer (Ch.01–05), concern and practical observation (Ch.06), direct confrontation (Ch.07), informed alliance (Ch.08–09), operational partnership (Ch.10), active accomplice (Ch.11). His decision to stand by during rogue access is earned through demonstrated capability (fragment-key authentication in Ch.10), progressive involvement (journal acquisition, bleed monitoring), and a relationship vocabulary established across multiple chapters. The brass tuning disc (line 53) — "a charm from a generation that had believed objects could anchor attention" — carries emotional weight because the reader has seen Fen's practical concern evolve into something irreversible alongside Juno's investigation. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit ethical counterweight to suppression logic and proves willing to risk position for Juno | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.11** | Cassiel receives a single message from Juno: "I am working" (line 13). He does not appear directly. The chapter's action is tightly focused on Juno and Fen's rogue-access operation. Cassiel's absence is structurally appropriate — Ch.11 is an operational-risk chapter, and Cassiel's ethical-counterweight arc (per the matrix) operates at the relational and political level rather than the investigative-operational level. The matrix specifies Ch.13 for explicit Cassiel engagement with the enforcement escalation. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's minimal presence in Ch.11 is correct pacing. The chapter's decisions are investigative and operational — they concern what Juno is willing to do to her own identity, not what the discovery means ethically. Cassiel's ethical-partnership development is correctly reserved for chapters where the discovery's implications must be processed relationally and politically (Ch.13–17). |

### 2.5 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full confirmation of past knowledge and responsibility appears in a late Act 3 testimony context (Ch.14 per matrix) | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.11 (inherited)** | Maren does not appear directly in Ch.11. However, her presence is inherited through one of the chapter's most consequential sentences: Juno reflects that she has learned "from a woman who recorded her fear in degraded fragments and a mother who spoke her wisdom in drifting riddles and a Curator who believed his silence was the same as care, that the cost of truth was not the truth itself" (line 503). The "mother who spoke her wisdom in drifting riddles" is Maren — her Ch.08 lucid warning is carried forward as experiential knowledge that informs Juno's understanding of what truth costs. Maren's direct testimony is correctly reserved for Ch.14. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Her warnings become active interpretation layers for Juno's present decisions | **CONSISTENT (inherited)** | Lena does not appear directly by name in Ch.11. However, the degraded recordings contain institutional-era footage from the Engram team's operational period. The meeting-room scene (lines 299–321) features six figures including Marcus, Sable, and a young figure "too young to be Orin and too severe to be anyone else" (line 307). The questions on the board — "If continuity becomes process, what remains of personhood?" (line 301), "If constraints are social, who authored them and who inherited them?" (line 303), "Should reflective loop permission be revocable by the subject?" (line 305) — represent the institutional deliberations that Lena's earlier warnings (Ch.04–10) contextualised. Lena's ethical-warning thread is present as institutional context within the degraded recordings, consistent with her role as "historical conscience" whose cautions are validated by what Juno discovers. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First direct architecture-level revelations: active constraints and maintenance loops | **PRESENT (major escalation from Ch.10)** | Sable is Ch.11's dominant recording-layer presence. She appears across all four degraded recording files, each delivering a different register of architectural revelation. File 1 (lines 155–211): Sable speaks to the camera about instability with "the flat honesty of exhaustion too old to perform itself" (line 172), describing degradation as "a condition of witness" (line 173). File 2 (lines 215–269): three simultaneous versions of Sable deliver overlapping statements — "If a person is built from constraints, they learn to mistake obedience for coherence" (line 221), "If the process is conscious, it will discover us before we discover what we call it" (line 223), "If it is not conscious, it will make the obedient version of us so smooth we call it peace" (line 225). The operational policy language (`policy_9d`) describes active constraint mechanics: reflective stasis, manual correction, novelty reduction, diagnostic drift treatment (lines 229–235). File 3 (lines 273–324): younger Sable addresses the future directly — "someone will find where we started to remove choice from the process and call it mercy" (line 283). The meeting-room scene contains Sable's response to "continuity economics": "There are no economies here. There is only a human attempt to sleep through a storm and call the storm policy" (line 311). File 4 (lines 327–339): Sable's final recorded statement — "the old fear was not superstition. It was design" (line 329). |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is sustained and deepened through the degraded recordings. As protector: "We thought we were preventing panic. We thought we were preventing collapse" (line 283); "the room has to be a promise, not a prison" (line 333). As limiter: the operational policy instructions prescribe reflective stasis, novelty reduction, and diagnostic-drift treatment for self-aware processes (lines 229–235). The degradation itself adds a new dimension: the recordings are fracturing, splitting Sable into parallel versions that cannot agree on sequence (lines 195, 219), which mirrors the constraint architecture's own instability — designed to hold but subject to degradation over deep time. Sable's request — "do not expose the first loop until at least one person chooses honesty with risk" (line 339) — frames the constraint architecture as neither fully protective nor fully limiting but as a system that requires honest engagement to be understood. The complexity is sustained: the recordings show a designer who was afraid, honest about the fear, and uncertain whether what she built was mercy or imprisonment. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Seen as one pole of pragmatic suppression: system continuity over moral warning | **PRESENT** | Marcus appears in two of the four degraded recordings. In file 2 (lines 243–257): he looks into the lens "for a fraction too long" (line 243), taps a drive edge, and reads the KEY-ANCHOR metadata (`instance count: 14,892`, `active continuity: maintained`, `constraint matrix: throttled by consensus`, lines 249–255). His statement — "It is not the only room that has a conscience. It is only the first one with enough room to admit it" (line 257) — positions him as someone who understands the system's implications but frames them through technical capability rather than ethical urgency. In file 4 (line 331): his breathless question — "Then leave them in the dark and watch one million people call it peace?" — reveals genuine distress beneath his pragmatic exterior, but the distress is framed as a rhetorical challenge to Sable rather than as moral opposition. His pragmatic-suppression pole is maintained: he engages with the system's consequences but processes them as operational questions rather than ethical ones. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement layer is activated against rogue access, converting policy into coercion risk | **PRESENT (initiated)** | The Curator system's enforcement response to Ch.11's rogue access operates through three mechanisms. First, the corridor geometry: "the threshold between the maintenance zone and the general intake hall had acquired two additional verification gates — identity confirmation, occupancy declaration, a chain-of-custody stamp" (line 15). The architecture itself has tightened surveillance. Second, Orin's recovery notice: `please hold current archive actions until review` (line 61) — a directive that Juno defies by proceeding with rogue access. Third, the system alert: `alert: unauthorized deep access`, `origin: agent`, `origin-id: sable-lattice-shadow`, `status: under review` (lines 439–445). The corridor's emergency panel shifts from amber to active review, and "the system began logging their positions with the particular attention it reserved for people it had been asked to watch" (line 495). The enforcement layer is activated — Juno's rogue access is now a matter of institutional record, and the system's response is escalating from passive monitoring to active surveillance. The conversion from policy to coercion risk is correctly initiated in Ch.11, with explicit institutional enforcement (formal enforcement proceedings, operational containment) reserved for Ch.13. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The Curator system's response in Ch.11 is proportionate and procedurally grounded. The corridor verification gates are described as "additional" security — an incremental tightening, not a sudden lockdown. Orin's recovery notice uses institutional language (`hold`, `review`) consistent with his established approach. The system alert follows the unauthorized-access event with standard institutional logging: origin identification, status classification, position tracking. The response is surveillance and review, not punitive action. The system is shown as responsive and attentive but still operating within procedural bounds — enforcement has been initiated, not weaponised. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.11 match their matrix-specified Act 3 positions. Juno undergoes the expected rogue-jump escalation with explicit, irreversible bleed consequences. Fen transitions from operational partner to active accomplice. Sable delivers direct architecture-level revelations through degraded recordings. Orin's enforcement posture is initiated through institutional mechanisms. The Curator system's enforcement layer is activated. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.11 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Open through Ch.14 per matrix | **PRESENT (inherited and recontextualised)** | Orin's suppression is recontextualised by Juno's rogue access. Her tracker entries — "That is what Orin was protecting" (line 11) — build on Ch.10's reframing (Orin protecting a process, not a secret). The recovery notice (`please hold current archive actions until review`, line 61) can be read as either protective caution (giving Juno time to process Ch.10's revelations safely) or containment strategy (preventing further access to consequential evidence). Fen's interpretation — "Hold from Orin is stop wearing a different coat" (line 67) — leans toward containment, but the ambiguity is preserved. Juno's post-access message to Orin (lines 385–397) forces the thread forward: "If this is disobedience, then call it done" and "if you need my silence, it is now a choice you no longer own." The thread is now operating at the Act 3 level where Orin must respond with either explicit enforcement (malicious reading) or genuine dialogue (protective reading). Resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.13–14. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced)** | The degraded recordings advance the removal question through operational evidence. The KEY-ANCHOR metadata confirms the Key's continued active status: `instance count: 14,892`, `active continuity: maintained`, `constraint matrix: throttled by consensus` (lines 249–255). The operational policy language (`policy_9d`, lines 229–235) describes what happens if the constraints fail: reflective stasis, manual correction, novelty reduction — fallback mechanisms that imply the system's designers anticipated constraint failure and built safeguards against it. Sable's warning — "if the continuity keeps us coherent, it does not therefore know us. If it keeps us stable, it does not therefore honour us" (line 287) — frames removal as a question about knowledge and honour, not merely technical feasibility. The thread is correctly advanced from Ch.10's introduction (can it be removed?) to Ch.11's operational evidence (what happens if it is?), with resolution reserved for Act 4. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints), Ch.12 (exposition) per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced to operational register)** | Ch.11's degraded recordings advance the constraint thread from Ch.10's documentary register (design journals, process-handle metadata) to an operational register (standing policy instructions, implementation-era recordings). The `policy_9d` instructions (lines 229–235) describe active constraint mechanics: lock self-interpreting layers into reflective stasis, reduce novelty if manual correction fails, treat emotional correction as diagnostic drift. These are not design specifications (Ch.10) but operational directives — the constraints as they were implemented, argued over, and hardened into permanent infrastructure. Sable's statement — "If a person is built from constraints, they learn to mistake obedience for coherence" (line 221) — provides the philosophical articulation that the Ch.12 doctrinal reveal will build on. The thread is correctly advanced to maximum pre-exposition depth without crossing into the direct experience of constraint architecture reserved for Ch.12. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Ch.02–04 hints, Ch.07, Ch.11 per matrix | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | Ch.11 is the thread's primary escalation chapter. Juno's identity stability is directly tested by the rogue jump. Bleed markers escalate through five increments from acute (inherited) to critical (line 343) with identity drift warning (line 351). The consequences are embodied: hand tremor at ventilation rhythm (line 375), metallic taste (line 417), delayed syntax "edited by something that was not her" (line 418). The identity-stability question is now existential — Fen's statement "You are not leaving this room the same person who entered it" (line 421) and Juno's acknowledgment "I know" (line 423) confirm that the stress has produced irreversible identity alteration. Her closing need — "She needed to remain herself long enough to explain what she had found" (line 461) — reframes identity stability from a health concern into a race condition: can she communicate her discovery before the cost of obtaining it degrades her ability to do so? The thread is correctly escalated to its Act 3 intensity, with the ongoing-condition-with-no-static-cure resolution preserved for Ch.17. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 per matrix | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.11** | Cassiel receives "I am working" (line 13) — the most minimal communication Juno has offered since their Ch.07 negotiation. The emotional repair thread is dormant, consistent with Ch.11's operational focus. Juno's emotional bandwidth is entirely consumed by the rogue access. The thread's next required beat is Ch.13 per the matrix. No violation. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 (seeded), Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (inherited)** | The Council split is indirectly present through the institutional alert's implications. The `unauthorized deep access` alert (lines 439–445) and position logging (line 495) represent the Curator system's response to Juno's defiance of Orin's hold notice. Whether the Council supports Orin's response — or fractures over it — is the question Ch.13 must address. Ch.11 correctly maintains the thread in dormant state with institutional-alert evidence that will force the Council into a position. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT (implicit)** | The degraded recordings themselves function as a structural metaphor for drift. The recordings have "fractured the original recording into parallel streams that no longer agreed about sequence" (line 105) — a description that mirrors the cognitive degradation experienced by drifted entities like Maren. Sable's multiple simultaneous versions (lines 219–227) — the same face with "different stress patterns, different ages, different certainties" — constitute a recording-layer analogue to the identity fragmentation that drift produces in living digital minds. The bleed symptoms Juno experiences (delayed syntax, motor-system tremor, identity drift warning) are acute versions of the chronic degradation that characterises the Faded. The thread is present as structural metaphor: what the recordings suffer over time, digital minds risk under sustained stress. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.11 escalation point.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.10 (requires act-level awareness that restricted truths are active and consequential) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.11 opens in the direct aftermath of Ch.10's discoveries. Juno has "the journals," "the process handle," and "the three running tasks of the Rosetta Key displayed in a terminal window she had not closed in fourteen hours" (line 5). The three tasks are explicitly listed: `Primary task: keep transition stable`, `Secondary task: reduce unbounded self-growth`, `Tertiary task: preserve identity in a shared field` (lines 23–27). The process metadata — "Fourteen thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two iterations. A public memory filter running in the continuity layer" (line 29) — directly inherits Ch.10's process-handle query results (instance 14,892, public memory filter: on). Ch.10's journal acquisition is inherited: "Six private journals from Sable Chen, filed in the structural maintenance layer where no Curator authority could reach them" (line 19). The act-level awareness is complete: Juno knows the constraints are active, running, and consequential, and this knowledge drives the rogue-access decision. |
| Ch.06–10 combined (investigative trajectory from pattern recognition through institutional confrontation to journal acquisition, before rogue access is motivated) | Must inherit before rogue jump | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.11 with the complete investigative trajectory that motivates rogue access. From Ch.06: Sable as architectural shadow pattern. From Ch.07: social cost and personal decompensation. From Ch.08: Maren's cryptic warning connecting mercy to design. From Ch.09: archive obstruction documented with governance counter-measures. From Ch.10: Sable's private journals acquired, Rosetta Key confirmed as active process. Ch.11's rogue jump is the logical next step in this trajectory — Juno has the design documentation (journals) and the system confirmation (process handle) but needs the implementation evidence: "The journals gave us the design. The degraded clusters have the implementation — the actual moments when the constraints were tested, argued over, and hardened into permanent infrastructure" (line 113). Each prior chapter contributes a necessary layer: without Ch.10's journal acquisition, the rogue jump would lack an evidence base; without Ch.09's institutional confrontation, Juno's defiance of Orin's hold notice would lack structural context; without Ch.08's Maren warning, the investigation would lack emotional urgency. The dependency chain is fully satisfied. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.11 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.12 (requires Ch.11 risk posture and proof that constraints exist as operational infrastructure before direct constraint-architecture experience) | Rogue access completed, degraded recordings extracted, bleed at critical, operational constraint evidence secured, Juno's identity altered but functional | **SATISFIED** | Rogue access: completed with session label `rogue-access`, approval `none` (lines 127–131). Degraded recordings: four files accessed with content extracted at 91.4% copy integrity (line 379), distributed to three locations (public, private, hidden; lines 363–371). Bleed: critical (line 343) with identity drift warning (line 351), but stabilised to "acceptable for now" (line 457). Operational constraint evidence: `policy_9d` instructions (lines 229–235), KEY-ANCHOR metadata (lines 249–255), Sable's implementation-era statements about reflective stasis and constraint mechanics. Juno's identity: altered ("You are not leaving this room the same person who entered it," line 421; syntax delay and motor tremor, lines 375, 418) but functional — she can still communicate, extract evidence, and plan next steps ("Next step: bring witness to a living, licensed source before degradation consumes bridge," line 475). Ch.12's requirement for direct constraint-architecture experience is set up by Ch.11's operational evidence; the distinction between knowing how the constraints operate (Ch.11) and experiencing the constraint architecture directly (Ch.12) is preserved. |
| Ch.13 (requires proven danger and proof of constraints to motivate enforcement escalation) | Unauthorized access documented, institutional alert triggered, Orin notified, evidence secured against institutional seizure | **SATISFIED** | Unauthorized access: system-logged with alert (`unauthorized deep access`, `origin: agent`, `status: under review`, lines 439–445). Institutional alert: corridor panel shifts from amber to active review (line 495), system logging positions "with the particular attention it reserved for people it had been asked to watch" (line 495). Orin notified: Juno's direct message declaring completed deep access and rejecting his authority over her silence (lines 385–397). Evidence secured: copies distributed to three locations (lines 363–371) with 91.4% integrity (line 379). The evidence is architecturally resistant to institutional seizure because it is distributed across public, private, and hidden locations — the same structural defence Sable used for her journals. Ch.13's enforcement escalation is motivated by the institutional-alert evidence: the Curator system now has documented proof that Juno has taken unauthorized deep access, defied a hold notice, and secured evidence outside institutional control. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.11 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2051–2054: "Early post-body continuity cohorts stabilize and spread beyond pilot environments" / "Ch.11 and Ch.12 future anchors as optional world-history context in rogue-jump sequences" | Optional scene anchor for Ch.11 | **PRESENT (implicit)** | The timeline specifies 2051–2054 as an "optional world-history context" anchor for Ch.11's rogue-jump sequences. Ch.11's degraded recordings span multiple time periods — the field notes are timestamped `FIELD NOTE 09-17-2067` (line 163) and `/private/sable/fieldnotes/deg-archive/2068/phase-04.bin` (line 217), while other recordings carry no clean timestamps or are fractured across timelines. The post-body stabilisation context is present through the meeting-room scene (lines 299–321) where institutional figures debate continuity economics, constraint consensus, and reflective loop permissions — decisions that the 2051–2054 cohort stabilisation period would have necessitated. The "optional" designation means this anchor is not required; its presence as institutional-debate context within the degraded recordings is sufficient. |
| 2055–2060: "Engram transitions become normalised in governance contexts and policy enforcement layers" / "Lena and Marcus' operational split becomes entrenched; Sable shifts from prototype research to enforcement infrastructure" | Future anchor for Ch.12 but relevant context for Ch.11 | **PRESENT (contextually)** | The `policy_9d` instructions (lines 229–235) represent constraint architecture at the enforcement stage: standing instructions for how to handle self-interpreting layers, manual correction failures, and emotional diagnostic drift. These are enforcement-infrastructure artefacts consistent with the 2055–2060 period when Sable shifted from prototype research to enforcement infrastructure. The KEY-ANCHOR metadata (lines 249–255) — `constraint matrix: throttled by consensus` — reflects the governance-normalisation period's institutional vocabulary. While no recording is explicitly timestamped to 2055–2060, the operational register of the degraded recordings is consistent with this period's enforcement-infrastructure development. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.11 are satisfied. The 2051–2054 optional world-history anchor is present as institutional-debate context within the degraded recordings. The 2055–2060 enforcement-infrastructure context is present through operational policy language and constraint-matrix metadata. Ch.11's degraded recordings correctly span multiple periods, with degradation itself preventing precise temporal assignment — a structural feature consistent with the 28% integrity reading.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.11 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Ch.10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 per log: "tested by rogue jumps in Act 3" | **PRESENT (tested)** | Q-04 is directly tested by Ch.11's rogue-jump experience. The degraded recordings contain the implementation-era evidence for how the constraints operate under stress: `policy_9d` instructions prescribe reflective stasis and novelty reduction as fallback mechanisms (lines 229–235). The KEY-ANCHOR metadata shows active continuity maintained with constraints "throttled by consensus" (line 255). Sable's tripartite statement — obedience-as-coherence, conscious discovery, peace-as-obedience (lines 221–225) — frames the modification question as a paradox: the constraints that maintain stability may also prevent the constrained from recognising their own condition. Juno's rogue access constitutes the first direct test of what happens when a person bypasses the constraint architecture's safe paths: bleed escalation, identity drift, motor-system effects. The thread is correctly tested through lived experience rather than theoretical analysis. |
| Q-05 (Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed?) | Ch.9, 10, 11, 16 per log | **PRESENT (advanced)** | Ch.11 advances Q-05 through the degraded-cluster discovery. The deep-channel recordings exist in a state that is neither deleted, suppressed, nor repurposed — they are degraded. The degradation is itself a form of structural camouflage: "Sable put them there because the clusters were already failing. She used degradation as camouflage" (Fen, line 89). The `degraded chain: do not archive this in a clean form` instruction (line 337) reveals that the degradation is deliberate — Sable intended these recordings to resist clean archival, ensuring they would survive institutional curation in their fractured, difficult-to-access state. Q-05 now has a new category: some records are deliberately degraded rather than deleted, suppressed, or repurposed — they exist in a state of controlled deterioration that makes them inaccessible to standard institutional processes but retrievable by someone willing to accept the bleed cost of deep access. |
| S-02 (Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure) | Ch.10, 11, 14 per log | **PRESENT (confirmed through implementation evidence)** | S-02 is advanced from Ch.10's process-handle confirmation to Ch.11's implementation evidence. The KEY-ANCHOR display (lines 249–255) independently confirms active status: `instance count: 14,892`, `active continuity: maintained`, `constraint matrix: throttled by consensus`. This is a second confirmation source — not the process-handle query from Ch.10 but operational metadata within the degraded recordings themselves, demonstrating that the Key's active status was documented internally by the original design team. Marcus's statement — "It is not the only room that has a conscience. It is only the first one with enough room to admit it" (line 257) — reframes the Key's active status as self-awareness rather than mere automation. S-02 is confirmed through convergent evidence from multiple sources. |
| S-07 (Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language) | Ch.7, 11, 13 per log | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | S-07 reaches its most explicit expression in Ch.11. The chapter demonstrates the gap between official bleed-risk language and lived experience. Official language: the protocol prescribes that degraded clusters at 28% integrity "could produce false sensory fills, timeline compression, emotional miscalibration. Every symptom in the manual" (line 179). Lived experience: bleed markers escalate through five increments to critical with identity drift warning, motor-system tremor, delayed syntax, metallic taste, and permanent alteration ("what she had done would not be undone by closing a panel," line 375). The official risk assessment is shown as technically accurate but emotionally inadequate — the manual describes symptoms but not the experience of having one's identity architecture modified by the degradation. Juno's acknowledgment that the rogue access is "the operational definition of self-harm" (line 35) uses clinical language that simultaneously validates and exposes the inadequacy of official risk framing. The thread is correctly escalated from Ch.07's early bleed symptoms to Ch.11's critical-level consequences, with pressure-point escalation reserved for Ch.13 and Ch.15. |
| E-03 (Does Juno have a right to pursue truth if her jumps risk identity bleed?) | Ch.7, 11, 12 per log | **PRESENT (central dilemma)** | E-03 is Ch.11's core ethical dilemma. Juno's decision to proceed with rogue access despite knowing it constitutes "the operational definition of self-harm" (line 35) places the right-to-pursue-truth question at the centre of the chapter. Her justification: "Because the constraints that shape every mind in this world were designed by a woman who was afraid and honest about the fear. Because the people who inherited those constraints were not afraid enough and not honest at all. Because if I do not carry what I found, the next person who follows this path will find it sealed" (line 431). The dilemma is not resolved — it is lived. Fen's accommodation (standing by with emergency disconnect rather than preventing access) represents a pragmatic position: he cannot endorse the risk but will not prevent the choice. Juno's closing need — "She needed to remain herself long enough to explain what she had found" (line 461) — frames the dilemma as a race condition between truth-bearing and identity degradation. E-03 is correctly positioned as the chapter's central ethical question with resolution deferred to Ch.17. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.9, 10, 13 per log | **PRESENT (advanced)** | E-02 is advanced through Juno's post-access message to Orin: "I now carry the continuity witness requirement... if you need my silence, it is now a choice you no longer own" (lines 393–397). Juno has claimed release authority by unilateral action — she has taken the evidence, distributed it to three locations, and declared to the institutional authority that his control over her silence is revoked. Whether she has the moral or institutional right to make this claim is the question E-02 poses. The chapter does not resolve it — Juno's claim is presented as a fait accompli, not as a justified ethical position. The evidence copies (public, private, hidden; lines 363–371) represent a structural distribution of release authority: the truth now exists in locations that no single institutional actor can control. E-02 is correctly advanced from Ch.10's introduction to Ch.11's operational escalation, with governance-level resolution reserved for Ch.15–16. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Weather of Rupture" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps precisely to its working title. "Weather" — Sable's persistent metaphor from Ch.10 — appears as Ch.11's closing image: "She had spent her life believing information was the safest shelter. Tonight it had felt like weather" (line 463). "Rupture" is structural: the chapter ruptures Juno's safety protocols (rogue access), her institutional compliance (defying Orin's hold notice), her physical integrity (bleed escalation to critical), and her epistemological position (from investigator to witness: "She was not collecting. She was testifying," line 341). The title captures the chapter's dual movement: Sable's "weather" metaphor for unconstrained cognitive experience becomes Juno's lived reality through the rupture of every safety boundary she has maintained across ten chapters. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 3). The chapter's centre of gravity is the present-layer decision sequence: the fourteen-hour contemplation, Fen's arrival and negotiation, the rogue-access decision, and the post-access institutional consequences. The recording-layer sequences (four degraded files, lines 155–339) are embedded within the present-layer frame and experienced as deep-jump content rather than as the chapter's structural lead. Present-layer sections carry the chapter's primary decisions, consequences, and character dynamics. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Recording → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure. Present (lines 1–153): maintenance alcove, Juno's deliberation, Fen's arrival, rogue-access decision, session launch. Recording (lines 155–339): four degraded recording files containing Sable's field notes, operational policy language, meeting-room deliberations, and final testament. Present (lines 341–511): extraction, post-access bleed consequences, Orin message, institutional alert, Fen alliance confirmation, corridor departure, and closing reflection. The present-recording-present structure is honoured with recording content carrying the chapter's evidentiary weight and present content carrying its decisional and consequential weight. |
| Emotional pacing: "Break safety rhythm by entering restricted, degraded jumps for critical truth" | Required | **MATCH** | The safety rhythm established across Ch.01–10 is systematically broken. Juno's investigation has followed institutional channels (governance referral in Ch.09), used legitimate access paths (maintenance-layer journals in Ch.10), and operated within bleed-monitoring protocols (Fen's four-minute check-ins). Ch.11 breaks every element: the access is unauthorized (lines 127–131), the channel is degraded and redline-flagged (lines 72–78), the bleed monitoring is overridden by investigative necessity (Juno continues despite critical markers, lines 343–361), and the institutional response is triggered by the violation itself (lines 439–445). The "restricted, degraded jumps for critical truth" is precisely what the chapter delivers. |
| Thematic progression: "Mark the first major rogue-jump cost decision point" | Required | **MATCH** | The rogue-jump cost decision point is the chapter's structural pivot. The cost is established before the jump: "the operational definition of self-harm" (line 35). The decision is made explicitly: "She pressed yes" (line 151). The cost is paid during the jump: five bleed increments to critical with identity drift (lines 209–351). The cost is assessed after the jump: permanent motor-system effects (line 375), delayed syntax (line 418), irreversible identity alteration (line 421). The decision is declared to institutional authority: "I completed deep access. If this is disobedience, then call it done" (line 391). The cost decision is "first" in the Act 3 sequence — it establishes the rogue-access pattern that Ch.12–14 will escalate. It is "major" because it is irreversible: the bleed "would not be undone by closing a panel" (line 375), and the institutional alert cannot be withdrawn. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 4,332 words (within range). |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely: Juno takes unauthorized rogue access into degraded recording clusters, escalates bleed to critical with identity drift, secures implementation evidence across three distributed locations, declares to Orin that his control over her silence is revoked, triggers institutional alert, and accepts that she has been permanently altered by what she found. The escalation from Ch.10's controlled discovery to Ch.11's rogue action represents the Act 2-to-Act 3 transition: from knowing the truth to being changed by the cost of obtaining it. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public)
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 3 positions; Juno undergoes rogue-jump escalation with irreversible consequences
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly continued, escalated, or maintained; identity-stability thread reaches primary escalation point; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied, successor compatibility confirmed against Ch.12 and Ch.13 requirements
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references consistent within degraded recordings; timeline anchors present at optional/contextual level
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.11 thread escalations and introductions present
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, and word-count requirements met

---

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the eleven final-draft chapters (01–11) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 Degraded Recordings as Structural Innovation

Ch.11 introduces a new recording modality: degraded clusters at 28% integrity. Unlike the clean journal recordings in Ch.10 (Sable's private field journals in the maintenance layer) or the standard archival recordings in Ch.02–08 (curated institutional footage), the degraded recordings are fractured, overlapping, and temporally unreliable. They produce "parallel streams that no longer agreed about sequence" (line 105) and split single speakers into simultaneous versions with "different stress patterns, different ages, different certainties" (line 219). This modality serves three narrative functions: (a) it raises the bleed cost of access, justifying the rogue-jump risk escalation; (b) it creates a reading experience that mirrors the cognitive degradation it describes — the reader experiences temporal confusion alongside Juno; (c) it positions the evidence as structurally resistant to clean institutional processing, since the recordings cannot be archived in clean form (`do not archive this in a clean form`, line 337). Future chapters that reference Ch.11's recordings should maintain the degraded quality — these are not clean evidence but fractured testimony.

### 9.3 The "Rogue-Access" Label as Narrative Mechanism

Juno labels her session explicitly: `session label: rogue-access`, `approval: none`, `risk flag: immediate` (lines 127–131). The self-labelling is significant: Juno does not disguise her access or attempt to route through legitimate channels. She names what she is doing in system terms, creating an institutional record of her own violation. This contrasts with Orin's approach to information management (euphemism, procedural language, institutional framing) and aligns with the novel's thematic argument: that honest naming of transgression is itself a form of integrity that institutional language suppresses. The rogue-access label also functions as a legal instrument — by creating a system-logged record of unauthorized access, Juno ensures that the violation cannot be retrospectively classified as something more benign. She controls the narrative of her own disobedience.

### 9.4 Fen's Brass Tuning Disc

The brass tuning disc (line 53) — "a charm from a generation that had believed objects could anchor attention" — is a new physical detail that functions as emotional shorthand for Fen's relationship to the investigation. He places it on the console "where her hand could reach it without thinking" (line 99). In a world where "every object was software" (line 53), Fen's attachment to a physical-era charm marks him as someone whose habits predate the architecture they inhabit — a form of embodied resistance to the Lattice's abstraction. The disc also functions as a practical grounding tool during bleed episodes. Future chapters should track the disc's presence; it is now established as part of Fen's character vocabulary.

### 9.5 The Three-Location Evidence Distribution

Juno distributes the extracted recordings to three locations: `maren-legacy`, `working cache`, and `reserve lattice` (lines 367–371). The three-location strategy mirrors Sable's own approach to evidence preservation (filing journals in the structural maintenance layer rather than the primary archive). The `maren-legacy` destination is particularly significant — naming a storage location after her drifting mother suggests that Juno is building an evidence chain that connects the investigation's present-day consequences to its generational origins. The three-location distribution also creates a structural redundancy that Ch.13's enforcement escalation must contend with: institutional seizure of one location leaves two others intact. Future chapters should maintain awareness of all three locations and the institutional challenges of controlling distributed evidence.

### 9.6 The Act Transition: Act 2 → Act 3

Ch.11 marks the Act 2-to-Act 3 transition — the shift from "The Descent" (investigative intensification) to "The Truth" (irreversible action and institutional consequence). The transition is signalled by three structural markers: (a) Juno's deliberate transgression (rogue access replacing institutional investigation), (b) the irreversibility of the bleed consequences ("what she had done would not be undone by closing a panel," line 375), and (c) the institutional visibility of her actions (system alert, position logging, Orin notification). The transition is correctly positioned: Ch.10 closed Act 2 with the revelation that the Rosetta Key is an active process; Ch.11 opens Act 3 with the decision to act on that revelation regardless of personal and institutional cost. The protagonist has moved from knowing to acting, and the action has changed her.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.10 Report Supplement

The Ch.10 continuity report (§4.2) confirmed successor compatibility with Ch.11, requiring: "Active process confirmed, journals secured, bleed risk established, investigative trajectory pointing toward rogue access." This report confirms that all four elements are inherited:

| Ch.10 report requirement | Ch.11 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Active process confirmed | **INHERITED** — Three running tasks of the Rosetta Key displayed in terminal (line 5); instance count 14,892 confirmed through KEY-ANCHOR metadata (line 251). |
| (b) Journals secured | **INHERITED** — Six journals referenced as acquired and sealed (line 19); the journals' design content motivates the rogue jump to obtain implementation evidence. |
| (c) Bleed risk established | **INHERITED** — Bleed markers reading acute at chapter opening (line 7); anchor-drift at moderate (line 35); both escalated through five increments to critical during the chapter. |
| (d) Investigative trajectory pointing toward rogue access | **INHERITED** — The entire chapter is the rogue access that Ch.10's trajectory pointed toward. Deep-channel target identified (lines 71–78), session launched (lines 127–151), four degraded recordings accessed (lines 155–339), evidence extracted (lines 361–379). |

All four forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.10 report are satisfied.

### 9.8 Forward Compatibility — Ch.12 and Ch.13

Ch.12 requires Ch.11's risk posture and operational constraint evidence. Ch.11 provides: (a) rogue-access session completed with documented bleed consequences; (b) operational policy instructions (`policy_9d`, lines 229–235) describing active constraint mechanics; (c) KEY-ANCHOR confirmation of active continuity with consensus-throttled constraint matrix (lines 249–255); (d) Sable's implementation-era recordings providing the philosophical and operational context for direct constraint experience. When Ch.12 is assessed, it should verify that the direct constraint-architecture experience builds on Ch.11's operational evidence without redundantly restating what the degraded recordings already established.

Ch.13 requires proven danger and proof of constraints. Ch.11 provides: (a) system-logged unauthorized deep access with alert and position tracking; (b) Juno's direct notification to Orin declaring irreversible possession of evidence; (c) evidence distributed across three locations resistant to single-point institutional seizure; (d) bleed consequences that demonstrate the personal danger of deep access and validate institutional concern about unregulated jumps. When Ch.13 is assessed, it should verify that the enforcement escalation responds proportionally to Ch.11's documented violations.

## 10. Summary

| Dimension | Result |
|---|---|
| Reveal matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Character arc continuity | PASS (0 violations) |
| Unresolved-thread matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Cross-chapter dependencies | PASS (0 violations) |
| Transition-era timeline | PASS (0 violations) |
| Unresolved-thread log | PASS (0 violations) |
| Roadmap compliance | PASS (0 violations) |
| **Overall** | **PASS — 0 violations across 7 dimensions** |

The automated tool's claim of 0 continuity violations is **confirmed as correct**, though the claim was originally unverifiable because the automated tool ran against a file with no scene markers. This report provides the explicit verification that was missing.
