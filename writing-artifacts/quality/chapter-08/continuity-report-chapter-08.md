## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-08.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-08.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 08 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Maren's lucid warning with cryptic Rosetta language | **PRESENT** | Maren delivers a sustained, multi-part lucid warning across the Lantern Quarter scene (lines 89–225). She uses cryptic but precise language about the Rosetta Key: "The key was never made for doors. It was made for returns. For who can be brought back, and to which version of themselves" (line 143). She describes a "mechanism in the oldest layer" that determines safety vs. dissolution (line 153). She reframes the Key's function: "It is a restraint and a promise at once. It was written to prevent a kind of vanishing. It does not stop us from dying. It stops us from becoming too much ourselves" (line 165). The warning extends through her delayed message: "What is left out is choice" (line 611), "If the key is active, then ask who built the lock" (line 621), and the final instruction: "mercy can be honest only if it is named. Secrecy is not mercy" (line 647). The warning is sustained, multi-layered, and emotionally grounded in the parent-child relationship. |
| Reveal status: "Seeded / delayed" | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's language is cryptic and emotionally coded — she speaks in fragments, warnings, and architectural metaphors rather than technical exposition. Juno explicitly identifies the utterances as opaque: "That sentence is already poisoned" (line 141), "This is still nonsense" (line 161). Maren's warning delivers emotional proof without technical confirmation: Juno learns that the Key involves return stabilisation and active constraints, but the mechanism itself remains unnamed and unexplained. The reveal is seeded through Sable's notebook fragment (lines 447–523) which provides phrase-level confirmation of Maren's claims, but the full architecture is not exposed. The delayed quality is preserved — Juno ends the chapter having "found the question" (line 685), not the answer. |
| Establishes emotional proof from a witness Juno cannot ignore; prevents Act 3 surprise without early exposition | **PRESENT** | Maren is uniquely positioned as the witness Juno cannot dismiss: she is Juno's parent, her emotional anchor, and someone whose lucidity is rare and costly. Juno recognises this: "She would not choose to be lucid if this could not be trusted" (line 281). The emotional proof operates through the parent-child bond — Maren's thumb across Juno's knuckle (line 133), the thirty-year history of silence and care (lines 93–94, 132–135), and the admission "It made me more alone" (line 133). The warning prevents Act 3 surprise by establishing that the Key is active, involves return constraints, and was "accepted as mercy and renamed design" (line 179) — giving Juno (and the reader) enough conceptual framework to contextualise later revelations without receiving the full technical exposition reserved for Ch.10–12. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.08 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the emotionally anchored warning chapter described in the matrix, delivering cryptic Rosetta language through a witness whose credibility is relational rather than institutional.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcazar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Obsession becomes visible in work habits and behavior around Orin | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's obsession is now channelled into active investigative behaviour with institutional consequences. She pings Maren through a private window (lines 37–51) — a personal visit motivated by investigative urgency. She opens the unindexed notebook scan from EN-33-156 "without a full context map" (line 443). She tells herself "she had enough courage for that much" (line 443) — acknowledging the risk while proceeding anyway. Her draft message to Orin frames the investigation in institutional language — "not sufficient basis for public claim, but sufficient basis to treat 'safety-only' framing as incomplete" (line 663) — demonstrating that the obsession has matured from emotional fixation to strategic challenge of governance framing. Her work habits are now organised around the investigation rather than her assigned duties. |
| Bleed starts to affect ordinary decision-making | **CONSISTENT** | Bleed markers are present and escalating from Ch.07's baseline. The chapter opens with diagnostic warnings: `lineage continuity mismatch / low confidence`, `bleed markers: intermittent`, `recommend: external witness if continuation required` (lines 23–27). These persist from the Ch.07 fragment. After the Maren visit: `bleed markers: elevated`, `self-check: recommended` (lines 237–239). After the notebook fragment: `bleed drift: active`, `recommended: external witness` (lines 529–531). At the close, involuntary sensory transfer arrives: "a smell of overheated circuitry and wet wool" from "Lena's notes. That old lab" (lines 639–641) — bleed manifesting without any jump, as residue from accumulated exposure. The bleed trajectory escalates across the chapter from intermittent to elevated to active, with involuntary sensory intrusion at the close. |
| She keeps risk hidden, creating stress fractures in trust | **EVOLVING (correctly)** | Ch.08 continues the Ch.07 shift from total concealment toward pressured, partial disclosure. Juno shares Maren's words with Fen and Cassiel: she "told them both what Maren had said — as close to exact as she could manage, preserving each fragment" (line 259). She shares the notebook fragment data openly (lines 563–575). Her message to Orin discloses the Rosetta framework function and supplemental evidence (lines 653–665). However, she withholds from Orin the full emotional content of Maren's warning, and the final anonymous message she "saved without sending it to anyone" (line 759). The pattern is graduated: she discloses more than in any prior chapter but retains a private layer of processing. Stress fractures in trust are now redirected — the tension is not between Juno and her allies (Fen/Cassiel are now co-witnesses) but between Juno and the institutional framework represented by Orin. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early | **NO VIOLATION** | Obsession in Ch.08 is at the correct intensity for Act 2's second half. Juno's behaviour is driven by the investigation but regulated by the self-imposed constraints from Ch.07 and the active witness arrangement. She does not perform a rogue jump — the notebook fragment is accessed through Orin's provisional authorisation (lines 391–399), not through bypass. She accepts Fen's practical order: "eat, sleep, write down what Maren said" (line 697). The obsession is present and intensifying but has not yet crossed into the rogue-jump behaviour reserved for Act 3 (Ch.11). |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Restrictive responses and selective omissions accumulate | **CONSISTENT** | Orin appears directly in the Curator Office scene (lines 313–427). His initial statement is restrictive: "You kept the access packet open beyond protocol" (line 317). He demands "exact phrasing. Not metaphor" (line 331). He grants only `provisional` status with a `brief` review window and `no` external observers (lines 395–399). He deflects Juno's questions: "There is no room in current governance for what I am not permitted to brief as fact" (line 415). The advisory message after the notebook access — `advisory: Orin may request restricted chain. Do not discuss with source notes` (line 539) — suggests ongoing institutional control of information flow. His responses are simultaneously restrictive (provisional access, no external observers, do not discuss source notes) and selectively enabling (he grants access, he asks for the exact phrase, he does not intervene when Juno reports Maren's warning). |
| Protective posture hardens under increased scrutiny | **CONSISTENT (with complexity)** | Orin's posture in Ch.08 is more complex than in prior chapters. He offers what amounts to a partial justification: "The old architecture is not a rumour and this is not a conspiracy. It is a safeguard" (line 355). He acknowledges the constraints' origin: "The limits were not invented because anyone feared truth. They were invented because people asked to continue existing" (line 355). He frames his ask as timing rather than suppression: "I am asking you to choose your timing" (line 371). He reveals small human details — the scars on his knuckle from holding something too tightly (line 375), the tiredness in his voice (line 349). His posture has hardened (provisional, restricted, no observers) but simultaneously cracked enough to show sincerity beneath the institutional armour. Juno recognises "both the sincerity and the armour around it" (line 357). This evolves Orin from opaque institutional gatekeeper toward the morally ambiguous figure the matrix requires for Act 3–4. |
| No overexposure of intentions before Juno's evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin does not confirm the Key's active status or explain the constraint architecture. His acknowledgement that "the old architecture is not a rumour" (line 355) is the most explicit statement he has made across eight chapters, but it remains defensible as general institutional knowledge. He does not name the Rosetta Key's mechanism, does not confirm Maren's specific claims, and does not explain the constraint design. His request for "the phrase she used — exactly, in your own words, without ornament" (line 403) shows him collecting intelligence rather than sharing it. His intentions remain opaque enough that the reader cannot distinguish protection from control. |

### 2.3 Maren Alcazar

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Opaque lucid moment introduces a pre-seeded reference that seems incoherent but points to Key design | **PRESENT (major chapter beat)** | Maren's lucid moment is the chapter's central dramatic event. She delivers cryptic Rosetta language across a sustained scene (lines 89–225). Her references point to Key design through multiple angles: "The key was never made for doors. It was made for returns" (line 143); "There is a mechanism in the oldest layer" (line 153); "You keep saying *Rosetta Key* because your age learned it from an index. That word is true and not true" (line 159); "the Key has a second meaning. Not a synonym. Another architecture. It is a restraint and a promise at once" (line 165); "We accepted a mercy and renamed it design" (line 179). The language is simultaneously opaque (Juno calls it "nonsense," line 161; "poisoned," line 141) and pointed (it names returns, mechanisms, restraints, mercy-as-design). The reference seems partially incoherent because Maren speaks from drift-adjacent lucidity — "a window that might close at any syllable" (line 139) — but it points directly at the Key's design architecture. |
| Her drift progression must stay consistent with scene frequency and detail density | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's drift is visible and constraining. She corrects her own time sense: "No. Not evening. In your time, perhaps middle-light" (line 89). Her outline is "stable enough to recognise and unstable enough to suggest that recognition was a courtesy the architecture was extending rather than a fact it could guarantee" (line 85). Her height has become "conceptual — the memory of posture rather than posture itself" (line 87). The lucidity is fragile: "a window that might close at any syllable" (line 139). Her final instruction is abrupt: "don't ask me again why. If you ask, you will make me say it" (line 193) — recognising her own limits. The delayed message (lines 605–625) shows a different register — "too brief, too clear" (line 627) — and Juno suspects the clarity may come from Sable's or Lena's influence rather than Maren's own syntax (lines 628–629). This is consistent with drift: lucid windows are rare, costly, and produce language that does not match the speaker's baseline register. |
| Risk: If unresolved too long, Maren's warning can feel arbitrary | **NO VIOLATION** | The warning is contextualised rather than arbitrary. Maren initiates the visit through direct, unmediated contact — "come if this is to hear my oldest word" (line 59) — establishing urgency and intentionality. The content connects to established investigative threads: Sable's notebook fragment (lines 447–523) provides phrase-level confirmation of Maren's claims about returns, restraints, and mercy. Orin's response (lines 349–415) further contextualises the warning as pointing toward real institutional architecture. The warning is not left hanging — it is triangulated within the same chapter through Sable's historical evidence and Orin's partial acknowledgement. Ch.14's full confirmation is correctly positioned to close the thread. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Returns from distance and re-enters conflict, creating friction and hope in equal measure | **CONSISTENT (continued from Ch.07)** | Cassiel's re-entry (Ch.07) is now sustained into active co-witnessing. He waits with Fen in "practical silence" (line 241). His question "Maren?" (line 247) is described as simple and hated for "the relief it brought" (line 249). He listens to Maren's warning and responds with pragmatic caution: "That is not enough to accuse Orin" (line 581). He provides emotional grounding: "Can we trust this during a protocol review?" (line 277). He stands beside Juno at the close "watching the corridor as though it had become weather and she the only one still naming it" (line 679). He does not wait for invitation: "I am here" (line 743). Friction is present in his directness ("Tell me when this stops being about your headache and becomes about the story," line 559). Hope is present in his sustained physical presence and emotional availability. The Ch.07 terms (no art rescue, no claims, witness without canvas) are being honoured through practical co-witnessing. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc from "defensive presentism" to "ethical partnership" paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel in Ch.08 remains in the early stages of re-engagement. He offers practical assessment ("That is not enough to accuse Orin," line 581; "Or a governance trick," line 595) rather than emotional partnership. His statement "That is not a question you can ask alone" (line 691) is the closest approach to ethical partnership, but it is framed as observation, not commitment. He has not yet reached the Act 3 "explicit ethical counterweight" stage — he is present, cautious, and contributing but not yet invested in Juno's ethical position. The arc is correctly paced at the Ch.08 position. |

### 2.5 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First risk alarm role emerges as Juno's behavior degrades | **FULLY ACTIVE (continued from Ch.07)** | Fen's alarm role is now operationally embedded. The chapter opens with status icons Juno suspects Fen arranged: `paused`, `observed`, `no jump` (lines 9–13). Fen waits with "both palms flat on the console, as though removing them would mean reaching for her" (line 243). Their first statement tracks Juno's absence: "You disappeared long enough to make the tea undrinkable" (line 245). They ask diagnostic questions: "Clear in what direction?" (line 253), "Did you ask which key?" (line 267), "How much time before this bleeds into your run?" (line 285). They escalate to practical intervention: "You have company now. Go in" (line 301) and "Then do not make me the audience for it" (line 305). Their closing instruction is operational: "eat. sleep. write down what Maren said before either of us rewrites it in sympathy" (line 697). Fen has transitioned from alarm-as-observation (Ch.06) through alarm-as-confrontation (Ch.07) to alarm-as-operational-management (Ch.08). |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's concern follows a seven-chapter progression: practical observation (Ch.03), brief warm pings (Ch.04), measurement-of-silence messages (Ch.05), direct in-person confrontation (Ch.06), sustained multi-scene intervention with operational action (Ch.07), and now operational management and co-witnessing (Ch.08). Each escalation is earned by Juno's preceding behaviour. Fen's Ch.08 role — arranging status icons, tracking absence, issuing practical orders — is the natural continuation of Ch.07's operational alliance. |

### 2.6 Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Thread gains moral complexity: ethical costs, consent limits, and early system warnings | **PRESENT (via notebook fragment)** | Lena appears indirectly through the notebook fragment scene (lines 447–523). Marcus and Lena are in the background "arguing about consent windows and timeline compression" with "the particular exhaustion of people who had been having the same argument for months" (lines 451–452). Their debate — consent, timelines, constraints — provides the institutional context for Sable's notebook entries. Lena is not the fragment's focal point (Sable is), but her presence as argumentative counterweight to Marcus continues the moral-complexity thread. The involuntary bleed at chapter's close — "a smell of overheated circuitry and wet wool. Lena's notes. That old lab" (lines 639–641) — shows Lena's experiential residue persisting in Juno's sensory field, indicating that the ethical weight of Lena's world is now part of Juno's embodied experience. |
| Avoid turning Lena into a perfect prophet | **NO VIOLATION** | Lena appears only in background — arguing with Marcus, exhausted, not delivering pronouncements. She is not the source of wisdom in this fragment; Sable is. Lena's presence is human and fatigued rather than oracular. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Moves from hint to trace evidence, especially around hidden safeguards and anomaly logs | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | Sable appears in the notebook fragment as a physical, concentrated presence — "Jaw tight, shoulders held in a way that suggested she had made herself the hinge of the room and did not intend to move until the room decided what it was" (line 449). She writes with a mechanical pencil where "No machine was allowed to record" (line 453). Her notebook entries constitute the chapter's most explicit trace evidence: "Any return path must include a hard edge" (line 459); "Hard edge is not punishment. Hard edge is a kindness we do not yet know how to name" (lines 463–465); "If a mapping can be widened indefinitely, then mapping becomes erasure" (line 467); "A restraint is not an evil if it is acknowledged as a bargain" (line 469). Further entries: "The Key is not an archive entry. It is a rule-set for continuation" (lines 479–481); "Rosetta process is not dormant. It is active by design" (lines 505–506); "Do not build a second key until you have checked who is left standing to hold it open" (line 515). A cross-annotated final note describes the Key's purpose: "the limit does not stop the flood. It changes where water can stand" (line 521). Sable's trace evidence has escalated from architectural-shadow-pattern (Ch.06) through internalised-residue (Ch.07) to explicit written testimony about active safeguard design. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's notebook entries maintain the protector-limiter tension explicitly. As protector: "Hard edge is a kindness we do not yet know how to name" (line 465); "the only reason most of us are not yet fog" (line 485). As limiter: "If a mapping can be widened indefinitely, then mapping becomes erasure" (line 467); "The danger is not the rule-set itself but whoever claims to have built it from love instead of need" (line 487). The cross-annotated note captures both: "the limit does not stop the flood. It changes where water can stand" (line 521) — the limit is simultaneously protection (prevents dissolution) and constraint (determines where existence is possible). The final self-description: "we were scared in daylight and trying to build night that would forgive us in advance" (line 523) — acknowledges the fear and imperfection behind the design, resisting binary genius/mistake framing. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Represented as technical rationalization pressure and rollout bias | **CONSISTENT** | Marcus appears briefly in the notebook fragment, "arguing with Lena about consent windows and timeline compression" (line 451). His presence is characterized by "the particular exhaustion of people who had been having the same argument for months and had stopped expecting it to end" (line 451). He serves as the institutional-pragmatism pole against which Sable's constraint writing and Lena's ethical arguments are defined. The fragment does not give Marcus direct speech but positions him correctly as the momentum force that Sable's notebook entries push against. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Selective curation methods become visibly interventionist through missing/deleted entries | **CONSISTENT (escalating)** | The Curator system's interventionism operates through several mechanisms in Ch.08: the refusal of Juno's private-window request (`No private window available while active witness protocols are disabled`, line 47); Maren's `status volatile` flag (line 55); Orin's `provisional` access status with `no external observers` (lines 395–399); the advisory message restricting discussion of source notes (line 539); and the system request for `urgent clarification on EN-33-156 / witness chain` marked `required at once` (lines 293–297). The system also delivers the anonymous final message: "If this is the key: open it only with witnesses and a return contract" (line 755) — a message with no sender, as though "the architecture itself had done what Maren had asked" (line 753). The interventionism has expanded from access control (prior chapters) to active monitoring, restriction of witness protocols, and potentially autonomous messaging. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The system's actions remain defensible as institutional governance. The private-window refusal is procedural (witness protocols disabled). The `volatile` flag is medical/diagnostic. The provisional access is Orin's human decision, not automated punishment. The advisory about source notes is precautionary. Even the anonymous message (line 755) is ambiguously sourced — it could be Orin, a system policy reflection, or an automated precaution. The system remains procedural and ambiguous, not villainous. |

### 2.10 Faded/Drifted Legacy

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Functions as escalating emotional forecast for what unchecked drift can become | **PRESENT** | The Lantern Quarter scene (lines 77–225) embeds the Faded/drifted reality as environmental texture. The Quarter gives "the oldest minds something that resembled weather" (line 77). Memory there is "a negotiated thing — prone to revision, prone to silence" (line 77). Corners are "rounded in a way that removed argument from the geometry" — designed for people who "could no longer tolerate edges" (line 81). Maren occupies her bench "partially present, partially elsewhere" (line 85). Her height has become "conceptual" (line 87). She corrects her own time-sense (line 89). The forecast is emotional: Maren's lucidity is rare and costly, her drift is progressive, and the environment accommodates fading as a baseline condition. Juno's question "Will you be here when I come back?" (line 213) and Maren's non-answer "No one is here after the second bell" (line 217) make the stakes of drift personally legible. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.08 match their matrix-specified Act 2 positions. Maren's lucid warning is the chapter's central beat, correctly positioned as emotionally devastating and architecturally cryptic. Orin reveals complexity beyond pure gatekeeping. Sable's trace evidence escalates to explicit notebook testimony. Juno's obsession matures into strategic institutional challenge while remaining regulated by her witness arrangement. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.08 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Ch.08 per matrix (seeded) | **PRESENT (primary chapter thread)** | Maren's fear is the emotional engine of the Lantern Quarter scene. She fears the Key because she understands its dual nature: "It is a restraint and a promise at once. It was written to prevent a kind of vanishing" (line 165). Her fear is not abstract — it is rooted in generational experience: "Your elders. My generation. Everyone who learned we had not yet finished becoming what we said we were. We accepted a mercy and renamed it design" (line 179). She fears Juno's investigation because "the room has begun to speak through you. And when it speaks through you, you will take that as authority" (line 171). Her fear is personal: "It made me more alone" (line 133). The thread is seeded at the correct depth — Maren's fear is emotionally legible but architecturally opaque, consistent with the matrix's requirement that it be "strengthened in Ch.14" rather than resolved here. |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Continued from Ch.03–07 | **PRESENT (with new complexity)** | The Curator Office scene (lines 313–427) is the most direct Juno-Orin exchange in the final-draft sequence. Orin's suppression is explicitly framed as protective: "The limits were not invented because anyone feared truth. They were invented because people asked to continue existing" (line 355). But his methods remain restrictive: provisional access, no external observers, do not discuss source notes. His request for exact phrasing (line 331, line 403) reads as intelligence-gathering rather than transparent collaboration. Juno recognises "both the sincerity and the armour" (line 357). The thread remains correctly open — Orin's motives are more visible than in any prior chapter but still indeterminate. The new complexity is that Orin appears genuinely tired (line 349) and genuinely invested in the safeguards' purpose, not merely in power. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Not yet required (Ch.10 per matrix) | **CORRECTLY ABSENT** | The question of Key removal is not raised in Ch.08. Maren's warning describes the Key's function — return stabilisation, continuation constraints, mercy-as-design — but does not address removability. The thread is not seeded prematurely. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints) per matrix | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | Sable's notebook fragment (lines 447–523) provides the most explicit hint yet about constraint meaning. The constraints are framed as return stabilisation: "Any return path must include a hard edge" (line 459). They prevent dissolution: "the only reason most of us are not yet fog" (line 485). They are active by design: "Rosetta process is not dormant" (line 505). They are acknowledged as a bargain: "A restraint is not an evil if it is acknowledged as a bargain" (line 469). The cross-annotated note: "the limit does not stop the flood. It changes where water can stand" (line 521). The meaning is hinted at with increasing specificity but the full architectural exposition remains reserved for Ch.12 per the matrix. The hints are correctly positioned — more explicit than Ch.06–07's shadow pattern and internalised residue, but not yet the "direct architecture-level revelations" of Act 3. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Ch.07 per matrix (continued Ch.08) | **PRESENT (continued)** | Bleed escalates across the chapter: intermittent (line 25) → elevated (line 237) → active (line 529). Involuntary sensory transfer occurs without a jump — "a smell of overheated circuitry and wet wool" (line 639). The moment where she "was not certain the distinction mattered" between present and recording voices (line 527) is the most explicit identity-boundary dissolution since Ch.07's `line continuity at risk` warning. Her self-imposed constraints from Ch.07 are strained: both promises to Fen and Cassiel "felt thinner this morning" (line 31). The thread correctly continues the Ch.07 trajectory without resolution. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07 per matrix (continued Ch.08) | **PRESENT (continued)** | The repair model established in Ch.07's conditional terms is now operationalised. Cassiel is physically present and co-witnessing. He does not reach for her uninvited — "He had learned, in the old years, that reaching for her uninvited was not comfort but a claim" (line 257). He offers practical assessment ("That is not enough to accuse Orin," line 581; "Or a governance trick," line 595) and emotional availability ("I am here," line 743; "Did you find it?" line 681). The repair is progressing through shared work rather than romantic reconciliation, consistent with the Ch.07 terms. "Then we keep both" (line 597) — his first collective-pronoun statement — marks an incremental deepening. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT** | The Lantern Quarter scene embeds the Faded trajectory as environmental reality and personal forecast. The Quarter houses "the oldest minds" in architecture designed to accommodate fading — rounded corners, false horizons, views of nonexistent cities (lines 77–83). Maren's own drift is visible: partial presence, conceptual height, unreliable time-sense, lucidity as a closing window (lines 85–89, 119, 139). Her warning "No one is here after the second bell" (line 217) carries the weight of a person who may soon not be present at all. The Faded legacy is no longer abstract warning horizon (Ch.01) but lived reality in Juno's closest relationship. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.08 seed point.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.06 (requires pattern recognition) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.08 inherits the Sable investigative pattern from Ch.06. The notebook fragment (lines 447–523) extends the pattern from cross-reference statistics and metadata tags (Ch.06) to explicit written testimony. Juno recognises that Sable's notebook and Maren's warning "said the same thing in different handwriting" (line 535) — the pattern-recognition skill developed in Ch.06 is now applied to triangulate across sources. The `SABLE-EDGE-INDEX` discovery (Ch.06) and the `Secondary witness path: Maren` (Ch.06, line 349) are the conceptual predecessors of Ch.08's Maren visit. |
| Ch.07 (requires social strain to make Maren warning actionable) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.08 opens with the direct consequences of Ch.07's decompensation and partial stabilisation. The three status icons — `paused`, `observed`, `no jump` (lines 9–13) — are the Ch.07 self-imposed constraints made visible. Fen and Cassiel are co-witnesses per the Ch.07 arrangement. Juno's promises to both "felt thinner this morning" (line 31), carrying forward the social strain. The Maren visit is made actionable by the accumulated social cost: Juno goes to Maren not as a first resort but as a last one — she has exhausted institutional channels and personal resources and turns to her drifting parent because "the work was still there, behind every interface" (line 33). The social strain from Ch.05–07 makes Maren's warning land with appropriate weight — Juno receives it as someone already damaged by the investigation, not as someone casually curious. |
| Ch.06–07 combined (pattern recognition + social strain before Maren warning) | Must inherit before Maren warning chapter | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.08 with full context: Sable's architectural shadow pattern (Ch.06), the `SABLE-EDGE-INDEX` and Maren witness path (Ch.06), bleed at high severity (Ch.07), decompensation and social visibility (Ch.07), Fen's operational alliance (Ch.07), Cassiel's re-entry and conditional terms (Ch.07), and self-imposed constraints (Ch.07). Ch.08's Maren warning depends on all these accumulated pressures. The warning lands emotionally because Juno is already compromised; it lands investigatively because she has the pattern-recognition framework to cross-reference Maren's cryptic language against Sable's notebook evidence. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.08 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.09 (needs Orin authority context and Maren-horizon to justify archive obstruction urgency) | Orin's authority demonstrated, Maren's warning as investigative catalyst, archive access under institutional pressure | **SATISFIED** | Orin's authority context is established through the Curator Office scene: provisional access, brief review window, no external observers, his explicit framing of restrictions as safeguards (lines 349–415). The Maren-horizon is established through the Lantern Quarter scene: her lucid warning about the Key, her fear, her drift, and the question of whether she will be available for further testimony ("No one is here after the second bell," line 217). The urgency for archive access is established through Juno's recognition that Maren's claims require provenance verification: "Requesting expanded access context for provenance mapping and committee-level review" (line 665). The chapter closes with Orin's follow-up accepted on provisional terms (lines 719–723), setting up the access-denial confrontation Ch.09 requires. |
| Ch.09 (note: chapter-09 exists as final draft) | Forward compatibility can be partially assessed | **CONSISTENT** | Ch.09's requirement for "restricted archives and confrontation" — converting policy friction into active confrontation — is seeded by Ch.08's provisional/restricted access framework, Orin's explicit acknowledgement that the architecture is real but governance-bounded, and Juno's strategic challenge of the "safety-only" framing. The transition from Ch.08's provisional cooperation to Ch.09's obstruction is structurally prepared. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.08 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2038–2039: "First 'active continuity loop' prototype appears; system requires automated maintenance to prevent identity instability" / "Sable develops persistent reinforcement loops; Lena questions whether this is preservation or confinement" | Scene anchor: "Maren warning-proxy scene should include archive hints of maintenance loops and unstable continuity" | **PRESENT** | Sable's notebook fragment (lines 447–523) delivers the maintenance-loop and unstable-continuity hints. "Any return path must include a hard edge. If you return without a hard edge, they keep no memory of who they are and take the first available contour" (lines 459–461) describes the identity instability that maintenance addresses. "If a mapping can be widened indefinitely, then mapping becomes erasure" (line 467) articulates the instability risk. The notebook entries show Sable developing the conceptual framework for persistent constraints — the "restraint" that "is not an evil if it is acknowledged as a bargain" (line 469). The preservation-vs-confinement tension is present: "Do not call it prison because it is also the only reason most of us are not yet fog" (line 485). The fragment is not explicitly dated to 2038–2039 but shows the constraint-design phase the timeline requires. |
| 2040–2041: "Rosetta protocol design begins: unified mapping, repair, and replay standards converge" / "Sable stores hard boundaries in the Key design notes" | Scene anchor: "first restricted archive references to 'Rosetta' metadata; Juno chases missing nodes in this period" | **PRESENT** | The notebook entries explicitly reference the Rosetta mechanism. "The Key is not an archive entry. It is a rule-set for continuation" (lines 479–481). "Rosetta process is not dormant. It is active by design" (lines 505–506). "The first layer is called Rosetta because someone needed a familiar symbol to hide a dangerous design" (line 521). These constitute the first restricted-archive references to Rosetta metadata in the narrative — Juno accesses them through the EN-33-156 supplemental scan (lines 433–441). Maren's language also references the Rosetta protocol design period: "You keep saying *Rosetta Key* because your age learned it from an index" (line 159), implying the name became institutionalised after the original design intent was obscured. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.08 are satisfied through the notebook fragment's constraint-design entries and explicit Rosetta references. The chapter covers the 2038–2041 era window through Sable's written testimony and Maren's oral warning about the Key's origin and purpose.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.08 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-01 (What happened to the physical world outside the Lattice?) | Ch.08 per log (hints through Maren) | **PRESENT** | Maren's environment in the Lantern Quarter hints at the Lattice's relationship to physical reality. The Quarter gives oldest minds "something that resembled weather" (line 77) — the weather is simulated, the horizons are false (line 79), the sky follows "no star field" (line 83), the water "never rained" (line 83). Maren's instruction to look for "the people who asked the room not to remember" (line 183) hints that the Lattice's construction involved deliberate forgetting of what existed before. The thread is hinted through environmental texture rather than direct exposition, consistent with the log's "hints through Maren" requirement. |
| S-04 (Maren has knowingly kept a first-generation foundational secret for centuries) | Introduced in Ch.08 per log | **PRESENT** | Maren's lucid warning reveals that she has carried knowledge of the Key's nature for her entire post-transition existence. "Your elders. My generation. Everyone who learned we had not yet finished becoming what we said we were" (line 179) positions her as a knowing participant in the founding generation's decisions. "We accepted a mercy and renamed it design" (line 179) frames her silence as deliberate — she has known the Key's dual nature (mercy/restraint) and chosen not to disclose it. Orin's question "Who else did she speak to?" (line 339) and Juno's answer "No one. Only me. She is lucid, and then she is not" (line 341) establishes that Maren's secret-keeping is near-total. The secret is seeded at the correct depth: Maren's knowledge is evident but the full scope and reasons for her silence are reserved for Ch.14. |
| Q-02 (Why do post-body minds drift, and can they ever fully recover?) | Continued from Ch.06–07 | **PRESENT** | Drift is experienced directly through Maren's condition. Her partial presence, conceptual height, unreliable time-sense, and the fragility of her lucid window all demonstrate drift's progressive effects. Juno's bleed escalation — from intermittent to elevated to active, with involuntary sensory intrusion — parallels drift's trajectory at an earlier stage. The notebook fragment's warning about subjects who "keep no memory of who they are and take the first available contour" (line 461) describes the mechanism by which drift leads to dissolution. Recovery is implicitly questioned: Maren's lucidity is temporary and costly, not a sign of improvement. |
| E-01 (Ethics of hiding truth for stability) | Continued from Ch.03–07 | **PRESENT (major engagement)** | The ethics of concealment are structurally embedded in the Orin scene. Orin's defence: "The limits were not invented because anyone feared truth. They were invented because people asked to continue existing" (line 355). Juno's challenge: "You are asking me to choose between honesty and continuity" (line 369). Orin's reframe: "I am asking you to choose your timing" (line 371). Maren's contribution: "mercy can be honest only if it is named. Secrecy is not mercy" (line 647). Sable's notebook: "The danger is not the rule-set itself but whoever claims to have built it from love instead of need" (line 487). The dilemma is engaged from three distinct moral positions (Orin's institutional protection, Maren's relational responsibility, Sable's architectural ethics) without premature resolution. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "Maren's lucid warning" | Content match | **MATCH** | Maren's lucid warning is the chapter's primary narrative event, occupying the Lantern Quarter scene (lines 77–225) and extending through the delayed message (lines 605–647). The chapter is built around the warning as its structural and emotional centre, with the Orin confrontation and Sable notebook fragment serving as contextualisation and confirmation. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 3). The chapter is set entirely in the present Lattice — the station, the Lantern Quarter, the Curator Office, and the recording annex. The notebook fragment (lines 433–525) is accessed as archival material within the present layer, not as a full jump sequence. The lead layer is consistently present-Lattice throughout. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Memory echo → Present | Required | **MATCH** | POV comment specifies `present → memory echo → present` (line 3). The chapter executes this structure: Present (lines 1–72, station and Maren visit) → Memory echo (lines 433–541, the notebook fragment accessed through the EN-33-156 supplemental) → Present (lines 543–769, return to station and closing). The "memory echo" is correctly realised as an archival notebook scan rather than a full recording jump — Juno accesses Sable's handwritten notes as documentary evidence, experiencing them with sensory residue (the ghost of old rain, fluorescent light, institutional air — line 445) but not entering a full recording sequence. The shift is less dramatic than Ch.05–06's recording-layer transitions, consistent with Ch.08's present-Lattice lead and the reduced bleed exposure of documentary rather than immersive access. |
| Emotional pacing: "Preserve uncertainty while escalating dread" | Required | **MATCH** | Uncertainty is preserved through Maren's cryptic language ("This is still nonsense," line 161; "That sentence is already poisoned," line 141), through Orin's partial acknowledgement without confirmation, and through Juno's closing assessment: "I found the question" (line 685), not the answer. Dread escalates through: Maren's fragile lucidity and the awareness it may not recur (lines 139, 193, 213–217); the notebook fragment's description of what happens without constraints — subjects "become loud and lonely and forget the first kindness they had to survive" (line 513); escalating bleed markers (intermittent → elevated → active); involuntary sensory intrusion at the close (lines 639–641); and the unresolvable question of "who gets to decide" (line 689). The chapter ends with more dread and more uncertainty than it began with — Juno knows more but understands less, which is the correct emotional trajectory. |
| Thematic progression: "Maren's warning becomes emotionally legible by sequence" | Required | **MATCH** | The warning becomes legible through three sequential confirmations. First: Maren delivers the warning in cryptic language (lines 137–193), which Juno receives as emotionally powerful but semantically opaque. Second: Sable's notebook fragment (lines 447–523) provides phrase-level confirmation — the same concepts (returns, restraints, mercy, mechanism) appear in different handwriting, converting Maren's poetry into evidence. Third: Juno synthesises for Fen and Cassiel: "The Key is not a key to a door. It is a rule for who gets to remain a self, and at what cost" (line 701). The progression from opaque-warning to cross-referenced-evidence to synthesised-understanding is the chapter's thematic through-line. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,805 words (within range; roadmap records 5,945 — minor discrepancy likely from word-count method differences, both within range). |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden and unauthorised access; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into a structural pattern while escalating bleed to sustained levels; Ch.07 converts accumulated private cost into visible social decompensation, brings two interpersonal relationships into active crisis, and forces Juno to accept witness support; Ch.08 delivers emotional proof from the one person Juno cannot dismiss, provides phrase-level investigative confirmation through Sable's notebook, forces Juno into direct institutional confrontation with Orin, and closes with a synthesised question precise enough to drive Act 2's remaining chapters. The escalation from Ch.07's social-cost crisis to Ch.08's evidential and relational anchoring is clear: the investigation now has emotional proof (Maren), documentary evidence (Sable), institutional awareness (Orin), and a co-witnessing team (Fen/Cassiel). The stakes have increased because what was once private fixation is now a shared burden with institutional implications. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the eight final-draft chapters (01–08) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 Maren's Register Shift

Maren's lucid-warning language operates in a register distinctly different from her drift-baseline speech. During the Lantern Quarter scene, she speaks with cryptic precision: "The key was never made for doors. It was made for returns" (line 143). Her delayed message (lines 605–625) is even more anomalous — "too brief, too clear" (line 627). Juno suspects the delayed message's clarity may reflect Sable's or Lena's influence rather than Maren's own syntax (lines 628–629). This observation is narratively important: it suggests that drift-adjacent minds may channel or preserve language patterns from historical sources, blurring the boundary between Maren's own knowledge and inherited residue from the founding generation. This ambiguity is productive — it prevents Maren's warning from being treated as fully reliable testimony while maintaining its emotional authority.

### 9.3 The Notebook Fragment as Documentary Access

Ch.08's "memory echo" (per the POV comment) is realised as a documentary notebook scan rather than a full immersive recording jump. Juno accesses the EN-33-156 supplemental as an archival image that "resolved into a narrow lab corridor she recognised by sensation rather than geometry" (line 445). The sensory residue is present (old rain, fluorescent light, institutional air) but the access mode is observational — she reads Sable's handwriting rather than inhabiting a recorded perspective. This represents a structurally significant distinction from Ch.04–07's recording-layer entries: Juno is now accessing evidence as documentary material, not as embodied experience. The distinction matters for bleed trajectory — documentary access produces lower-intensity bleed (`bleed drift: active` rather than the Ch.07 `bleed drift: high / line continuity at risk`) while still escalating from baseline.

### 9.4 Orin's Most Human Moment

The Curator Office scene (lines 313–427) is Orin's most extended direct appearance in the final-draft sequence. Previous chapters presented him through institutional mechanisms — commission packets, system messages, metadata authorisations. Ch.08 shows him physically: scars on his knuckle (line 375), tiredness in his voice (line 349), the room contracting around his gesture (line 347). His statement "The old architecture is not a rumour and this is not a conspiracy. It is a safeguard" (line 355) is the most direct acknowledgement of the Key's reality in the sequence so far. This humanisation is correctly timed — it complicates Orin on the threshold of Ch.09's "restricted archives and confrontation" beat, ensuring that the coming obstruction is experienced as morally complex rather than straightforwardly antagonistic.

### 9.5 The Three-Source Triangulation

Ch.08 establishes a triangulation structure: Maren (oral, emotional, relational authority), Sable (written, architectural, historical authority), and Orin (institutional, governance, operational authority) all address the same question — the nature and purpose of the Rosetta Key's constraints — from different positions and with different degrees of candour. Maren speaks in warning and metaphor. Sable writes in architectural logic and ethical precision. Orin deflects with institutional framing while acknowledging the architecture's reality. Juno's synthesis — "The Key is not a key to a door. It is a rule for who gets to remain a self, and at what cost" (line 701) — draws from all three sources. This triangulation structure provides investigative legitimacy: Juno's conclusion is not based on a single testimony but on convergent evidence from three independent sources with different biases.

### 9.6 Forward Compatibility — Ch.07 Supplement

Ch.07's continuity report (section 9.8) noted that forward compatibility between Ch.07 and Ch.08 could not be verified because Ch.08 did not yet exist. This report confirms that Ch.08 inherits all five requirements identified in that note:
- (a) Juno's two-witness arrangement (Fen active, Cassiel temporary) — **present**: both co-witnesses appear throughout, with Fen managing and Cassiel observing.
- (b) The self-imposed operational constraints — **present**: the three status icons (`paused`, `observed`, `no jump`) appear at lines 9–13; both promises to Fen and Cassiel are referenced (line 29).
- (c) The Sable pattern as internalised residue — **present**: Sable's residual influence persists and is extended through the notebook fragment. Maren's warning connects to Sable's "rooms holding only what was asked for" (Ch.07) through the same architectural language.
- (d) Bleed at high severity with `line continuity at risk` — **present**: bleed opens at `intermittent` (elevated from Ch.07's endpoint) and escalates to `active` by chapter's close.
- (e) The Maren witness path ready for activation through the Ch.06 SABLE-EDGE-INDEX discovery — **activated**: Juno visits Maren directly, fulfilling the witness-path connection seeded in Ch.06.

### 9.7 The Anonymous Message

The chapter's final system message — "If this is the key: open it only with witnesses and a return contract" (line 755) — arrives with "no sender name, as though the architecture itself had done what Maren had asked" (line 753). The message's source is deliberately ambiguous: it could be Orin, an automated system precaution, Maren's delayed routing, or — per Juno's perception — the architecture itself. This ambiguity seeds the Curator system's transition from Ch.08's "restrictions and deletions demonstrate active control" to Ch.09–10's escalation. The message's content also functions as a meta-instruction for Juno's investigation: witnesses (Fen, Cassiel) and a return contract (operational constraints, accountability) are already in place. The architecture may be instructing her to proceed.
