## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-13.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-13.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 13 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Orin and Curator enforcement escalation is formalized as institutional policy response | **PRESENT** | Ch.13's entire narrative structure is built around the formalization of institutional enforcement against Juno. The chapter opens with a continuity hold notification: `incoming: continuity hold`, `scope: account-wide`, `reason: policy intervention`, `action: read-only` (lines 7–13). This is immediately escalated to a full account suspension: `account lock level 2`, `jump permissions: suspended`, `vault sync: frozen`, `governance referral: active` (lines 19–25). Juno is summoned to the Curator Continuity Forum (lines 47–55) — a formal institutional proceeding with anonymous Curators, enforcement officers, and Orin presiding. The charges are explicitly stated: "unauthorized access into restricted and degraded archival nodes" and "potential civilizational destabilization through premature infrastructure disclosure" (line 155). Orin presents three exhibits: Exhibit 13-A (Marcus Fell's 2068 governance-hearing statement arguing against premature disclosure, lines 217–227), Exhibit 13-B (a recovery report from a 62-agent continuity breach caused by unrestricted constraint bypass, lines 259–269), and Exhibit 13-C (a policy rationale excerpt establishing the doctrine that publication depends on institutional absorptive capacity, lines 405–417). The enforcement escalation concludes with a formal non-compliance declaration and extended hold: `status: non-compliance`, `recommended: extended hold`, `safety flag: maintain` (lines 539–545), followed by Orin's directive: "No direct jump access until further notice. No data transfer. No peer dissemination" (line 547). The escalation is procedurally complete — from administrative hold through formal hearing to extended suspension with formal review pending within one cycle. |
| Reveal status: "Public (operational)" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers public-operational revelation: the enforcement apparatus that protects the constraint architecture is now fully visible as institutional policy. The shift from Ch.12's doctrinal reveal (what the constraints are) to Ch.13's operational reveal (what happens when someone threatens to disclose them) converts the antagonism from personality conflict to governance structure, as the matrix requires. Orin's enforcement is not personal retaliation but institutional process: anonymous Curators, enforcement officers, formal exhibits, policy citations, and procedural declarations. The enforcement is "public" in the narrative sense — it is logged, recorded, and policy-scoped (line 151), creating an institutional record that future chapters can reference. It is "operational" because it converts the abstract threat of suppression (established in Ch.03–09) into concrete institutional action: account suspension, vault freeze, jump restriction, and dissemination prohibition. The reveal status matches the matrix specification: "Shifts antagonism from personality conflict to governance structure." |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.13 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the institutional-enforcement chapter described in the matrix, formalizing Orin's protective strategy as explicit coercive governance through procedural mechanisms.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She chooses rogue jump behavior and accepts overt risk; emotional and cognitive costs are explicit | **PRESENT (continued from Ch.11–12, shifted to institutional register)** | Ch.13 shifts Juno's risk posture from the physical/cognitive domain (Ch.11's bleed escalation, Ch.12's epistemic processing) to the institutional domain. Her bleed logs are presented during the hearing: `MILD: high`, `MODERATE: persistent`, `SEVERE: none` (lines 471–475) — confirming that Ch.11's rogue-access costs persist as ongoing condition. The costs are now also institutional: account suspension, vault freeze, jump prohibition, and the threat of permanent access loss. She explicitly refuses Orin's conditional-suspension offer: "I will not sign a lock as though we are colleagues in dispute about procedure" (line 485). She refuses the controlled-channel offer: her non-compliance triggers extended hold (lines 539–547). The overt risk is no longer physical bleed but civilizational: her decision to refuse institutional accommodation means the confrontation must escalate to public testimony. Her closing action — assembling a witness chain of three independent figures (retired Curator, continuity engineer, historian, lines 687–691) — represents the next escalation of risk: from private investigation (Act 2) through rogue access (Ch.11) through doctrinal understanding (Ch.12) through institutional defiance (Ch.13) toward public testimony (Ch.14–16). |
| Obsession at correct Act 3 intensity | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's Act 3 obsession has evolved from Ch.11's operational commitment (executing the rogue jump) and Ch.12's epistemic commitment (processing the constraint architecture) to Ch.13's political commitment (refusing institutional containment and building a witness chain). The evolution is correctly paced: she is not reckless or impulsive but strategic. She brings only two files to the hearing — "the constraint summary and the field log from Sable's degraded archive" — deliberately limiting exposure: "Two files are testimony. A full set is an arsenal they can confiscate" (lines 97–101). She makes Orin cite the formal ethics provision (lines 495–515), forcing the circular logic of protective withholding into the institutional record. Her closing formulation — "No consent, no continuation" (line 401) — is a principled position, not an obsessive outburst. The obsession is channelled into institutional confrontation rather than personal risk-taking, which is the correct Act 3 register for a chapter centred on governance enforcement rather than investigative discovery. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early (Act 2 concern) | **NO VIOLATION** | Ch.13's commitment operates at the institutional-political level, building directly on Ch.11's rogue access and Ch.12's doctrinal understanding. The distinction from Act 2 is preserved: in Act 2, Juno gathered evidence; in Act 3, she is defending the evidence against institutional seizure and building the framework for its disclosure. The escalation is sequential and earned through twelve chapters of progressive intensification. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit gatekeeper and enforcer; moves from persuasion to operational containment | **PRESENT (primary — chapter's central antagonist)** | Orin is Ch.13's dominant institutional presence. His enforcement trajectory reaches its most explicit expression across four escalation stages. Stage 1 — administrative hold: the continuity hold notification freezes Juno's account, vault, and permissions before the hearing begins (lines 7–25). Stage 2 — formal hearing: Orin presides over the Curator Continuity Forum with anonymous Curators and enforcement officers (lines 137–139), formally charging Juno with "unauthorized access into restricted and degraded archival nodes" and "potential civilizational destabilization through premature infrastructure disclosure" (line 155). Stage 3 — evidentiary argument: Orin presents three exhibits (Marcus Fell's governance-hearing statement, a 62-agent breach recovery report, a policy rationale excerpt) to justify continued suppression (lines 215–417). Stage 4 — non-compliance enforcement: when Juno refuses the conditional-suspension offer, Orin implements extended hold with no jump access, no data transfer, and no peer dissemination (lines 539–547). His trajectory has moved from Ch.03's commission authority, through Ch.09's policy friction, through Ch.11's recovery notice, through Ch.12's governance review and material seizure, to Ch.13's full institutional enforcement with formal charges, evidentiary proceedings, and extended suspension. The movement from persuasion to operational containment is complete. |
| No overexposure of intentions before evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain morally complex throughout Ch.13. His arguments are not cynical self-protection but genuine institutional concern: "Your disclosure risk is not that a few people will panic. Your disclosure risk is that people will conclude the Lattice has always lied to them. If that belief takes hold, no governance can survive it" (line 343). His most human moment — "Consent is difficult. Trust is slower" (line 561) — reveals a person who has spent centuries navigating the gap between ideal governance and practical necessity. His offer of a "third route" (line 361) and a public hearing under Curator terms (line 569) demonstrate that he is not purely suppressive but seeking managed transition. Juno's internal observation captures the complexity: "He was no longer speaking policy. He was speaking from the weight of centuries watching clarity arrive in rooms where no one had been prepared" (line 275). The chapter preserves the core ambiguity: Orin's enforcement is both protective (preventing civilizational destabilization) and controlling (denying consent to twelve million minds). Neither reading is definitively endorsed. |

### 2.3 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fully allied with Juno's high-risk phase, while retaining practical fears and questions | **PRESENT** | Fen appears in three structural positions: pre-hearing preparation, post-hearing debriefing, and witness-chain facilitation. Pre-hearing (lines 29–105): he arrives with three pulses — "The first was a request. The second was a worry. The third was a hand already reaching for the door" (line 29). His tactical advice is practical and specific: "choose what to say with your face, and what to say with the page. They can inspect the documents. They cannot inspect how you hold a room" (line 105). He walks with Juno to the forum threshold and stops where institutional boundary prevents him: "I need to be near enough to hear if you call. Not close enough to change what this is" (line 119). His parting warning — "Don't do this at the cost of your name" (line 123) — retains practical fear while affirming alliance. Post-hearing (lines 589–641): he meets her immediately, absorbs the outcome, and transitions to operational planning. His practical questioning persists: "Did it hold?" (line 591), "Did they lock you hard?" (line 603). His observation — "They always say it is temporary" (line 609) — demonstrates experience-based scepticism of institutional language. Witness-chain facilitation (lines 641–685): Fen holds the private channel steady while Juno records three witness names (line 685), functioning as operational infrastructure for the next phase. His alliance is fully operational; his practical fears are expressed through tactical caution rather than opposition. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's alliance in Ch.13 is the continuation of his Ch.11 accomplice role and Ch.12 waiting presence. His tactical advice ("choose what to say with your face") and his corridor-threshold stance ("not close enough to change what this is") demonstrate earned solidarity — he knows his limits and operates within them. His concern is expressed through practical calibration, not emotional alarm, consistent with his established pattern across eleven prior chapters. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit ethical counterweight to suppression logic and proves willing to risk position for Juno | **PRESENT (initiated)** | Cassiel appears for the first time in Ch.13 through a private communication channel (lines 643–707). His entrance is precisely calibrated: "You look like the same person they were afraid of" (line 653) — a sentence that acknowledges both Juno's danger and her consistency. His ethical-counterweight role is immediately established: "Protective deception is still deception" (line 657) — a position he has held "since the early weeks when the investigation had been academic" (line 657). His tactical contribution is specific and actionable: "Make one practical request they cannot hide behind. Ask for public-facing reasons and a date" (line 663). When Juno describes building a witness chain, Cassiel's response advances the ethical framework: "Do it with people who can stand in a room and say what they saw" (line 671). Juno's closing private message — "we need you in the witness chain. if you can speak without needing to heal me first" (line 707) — initiates Cassiel's transition from emotional history to ethical partnership. His willingness to engage despite the personal risk is demonstrated by his participation through the private channel under elevated risk conditions (`risk: elevated`, line 649) during Juno's extended hold. The matrix's requirement for Cassiel to become an explicit ethical counterweight is initiated: he provides the ethical framing (deception is deception), the tactical advice (demand transparency), and the alliance commitment (speak as witness). Full operational engagement with enforcement is correctly reserved for Ch.14–16. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's Ch.13 engagement is correctly paced. He enters through a private channel, not a public forum. His participation is advisory, not operational. Juno's request acknowledges the relational complexity: "if you can speak without needing to heal me first" — preserving the emotional-repair thread while advancing the ethical-partnership arc. Cassiel's acceptance is conditional on his own terms rather than immediate capitulation, consistent with the pacing the matrix requires. |

### 2.5 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full confirmation of past knowledge and responsibility appears in a late Act 3 testimony context (Ch.14 per matrix) | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.13 (inherited)** | Maren does not appear directly in Ch.13. Her presence is inherited through two structural echoes. First, Juno's reflection during Orin's argument: "She thought of Maren's hand tremors in old light" (line 375) — connecting the institutional debate about constraint disclosure to the lived experience of a person whose cognition has been shaped by the architecture under discussion. Second, Juno hears "Maren's voice beneath the words" of exhibit 13-C (line 419) — the policy rationale excerpt's language about institutional absorption of moral injury resonates with Maren's drift-affected wisdom. Both references maintain Maren as emotional anchor without advancing her confirmation arc, which is correctly reserved for Ch.14 per the matrix. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Her warnings become active interpretation layers for Juno's present decisions | **PRESENT (inherited through institutional context)** | Lena is directly referenced in one exchange. Juno asks Orin: "Then why was Lena given a door to ask questions in those recordings? Why was Sable permitted to document the design?" (line 523). The question uses Lena's historical access as an argument against present-day suppression — if the original design team permitted ethical questioning during implementation, the current governance structure's prohibition of similar questioning is a regression, not a precedent. Lena's warnings from earlier chapters (ethical concerns about consent, system limitations, moral complexity) function as the interpretive context for Juno's argument: the very questions Lena raised during the Engram era are the questions Orin is now preventing Juno from raising publicly. Lena's role as "active interpretation layer" is correctly present — her historical ethical access validates Juno's present-day claim to disclosure rights. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First direct architecture-level revelations: active constraints and maintenance loops | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (inherited)** | Sable does not appear in Ch.13's present-layer action. Her architectural revelations are inherited as the evidentiary foundation Juno brings to the forum. Juno's testimony explicitly names the constraint architecture: "Sable Chen's field observations. The constraint architecture is documented — perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary, drift suppression. All active. All operating on every mind in the Lattice without disclosure or consent" (line 211). Sable's private tracker line — "The architecture was built by someone who was afraid, and the fear was earned. The architecture was maintained by someone who was certain, and the certainty was not" (line 41) — frames the chapter's central argument. Additionally, Juno reflects on "Sable writing in a kitchen with a sink that ran yellow water" (line 375), carrying forward the embodied detail from Ch.12's field observations. The witness-chain construction is described as "Architecture — the kind Sable would have recognised" (line 685), explicitly connecting Juno's political strategy to Sable's design philosophy. Sable's direct presence is correctly concentrated in Ch.12's five field observations; Ch.13 inherits and deploys that evidence in an institutional context. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature persists through the chapter's central debate. Orin's argument represents Sable-as-protector: the constraints prevent the dissolution documented in the 62-agent breach (exhibit 13-B). Juno's argument represents Sable-as-limiter: the constraints operate on every mind without consent. The chapter does not resolve the tension — it stages it as institutional confrontation. Juno's formulation acknowledges both dimensions: "Your trust is built from fear of what the architecture might do without you. Mine is built from fear of what the architecture is already doing because of you. Both fears are honest" (line 565). The protector-limiter tension is sustained as the chapter's argumentative engine. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Seen as one pole of pragmatic suppression: system continuity over moral warning | **PRESENT** | Marcus appears through exhibit 13-A — a 2068 governance-hearing statement: "If this architecture can be made visible before social architecture is in place, we preserve no one. We merely replace one catastrophe with a better argument" (line 225). Orin uses this as his opening argument against disclosure. Juno immediately identifies the pragmatic-suppression dynamic: "Of all the voices in those meetings, you chose the man who prioritised engineering over ethics" (line 233). Orin's defence — "I chose the man who understood that good intentions do not survive bad timing" (line 235) — reframes Marcus's pragmatism as institutional wisdom. Juno's counter — "And now his words are preserved as justification for permanent silence" (line 237) — identifies the structural problem: Marcus's 2068 caution has been converted from a contextual warning into a permanent policy anchor, "still active, still shaping how the Curator order justified its custody" (line 241). Marcus's pragmatic-suppression pole is correctly deployed as institutional evidence, not personal antagonism. His words carry the weight of a design decision that has outlived its original context — a man's 2068 caution becoming a civilisation's permanent excuse. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement layer is activated against rogue access, converting policy into coercion risk | **PRESENT (primary — chapter's institutional antagonist)** | The Curator system's enforcement reaches its most explicit and formalized expression in Ch.13. The escalation progresses through five distinct mechanisms: (1) Administrative hold — account-wide continuity hold with read-only access (lines 7–13). (2) Full account suspension — level 2 lock, jump permissions suspended, vault frozen, governance referral active (lines 19–25). (3) Environmental restriction — ambient preferences trimmed as part of the hold; Juno's room is stripped to "a plain rectangle. No shadow. No depth. No weather" (line 37). (4) Formal hearing — Curator Continuity Forum with anonymous panel members, enforcement officers, policy-scoped recording, and evidentiary proceedings (lines 133–581). (5) Extended hold — non-compliance declaration triggers no jump access, no data transfer, no peer dissemination, formal review within one cycle (lines 539–547). The conversion from policy to coercion risk is explicit in the chapter's central exchange. When the Curator offers a controlled channel contingent on Juno acknowledging "current protections as operationally necessary" (line 291), Juno identifies the coercive structure: "Then this is not a hearing. This is custody" (line 467). The system's enforcement is procedurally comprehensive — it extends from data access through environmental comfort through institutional standing through communication channels. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The enforcement response is proportionate and procedurally grounded throughout. The hearing follows formal protocols: identity confirmation, purpose declaration, chain-of-custody stamps, timed entry, recorded session (lines 111, 143, 151). Orin presents exhibits and arguments rather than issuing unilateral decrees. The anonymous Curators function as institutional process, not personal antagonists. Orin offers multiple alternatives before escalation: a controlled channel (line 291), conditional suspension modification (line 483), and a public hearing under Curator terms (line 569). Each offer is refused by Juno before the system escalates. The enforcement leaves structural openings: the hold permits personal-contact channels "because even the governance apparatus recognised that total isolation accelerated the drift it claimed to prevent" (line 643). The system is shown as institutionally powerful but architecturally constrained — it can freeze accounts and suspend access but cannot seize what Juno carries in memory (inherited from Ch.12), cannot prevent personal communication, and cannot prevent independent witness assembly. The Curator system remains a governance mechanism operating within procedural bounds, not an omnipotent antagonist. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.13 match their matrix-specified Act 3 positions. Orin's enforcement reaches its most explicit institutional form. Juno shifts from investigative to political commitment. Fen provides tactical alliance. Cassiel's ethical-counterweight role is initiated. Marcus serves as pragmatic-suppression pole through historical exhibit. The Curator system's enforcement is proportionate and procedurally grounded. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.13 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Open through Ch.14 per matrix; mostly resolved Ch.13–14 | **PRESENT (deepened to maximum pre-resolution complexity)** | Ch.13 is the thread's most sustained examination. The hearing stages the full complexity of Orin's position. Protective reading: Orin genuinely fears civilizational destabilization — "people will conclude the Lattice has always lied to them. If that belief takes hold, no governance can survive it. Not because the facts are too much. Because trust, once named as deception, does not recover" (line 343). This is not institutional defensiveness but centuries of experience watching trust fail. His offer of alternatives (controlled channel, conditional suspension, public hearing) demonstrates willingness to negotiate. His most human sentence — "Consent is difficult. Trust is slower" (line 561) — reveals genuine moral struggle. Malicious reading: Orin assigns himself as arbiter of what twelve million minds are permitted to know. His "third route" must be "built first" (line 365) — an indefinite deferral that maintains his authority. His ethics provision is circular: "Protective withholding becomes indefinite when review can be compromised by panic" (line 509). He uses the 62-agent breach as evidence of disclosure danger, but Juno notes "No permanent deactivation" — the system protected itself (line 271). The thread reaches maximum pre-resolution complexity: both readings are simultaneously valid, and the chapter refuses to resolve them. Juno's formulation captures the symmetry: "Your trust is built from fear of what the architecture might do without you. Mine is built from fear of what the architecture is already doing because of you. Both fears are honest. Neither keeps anyone safe alone" (line 565). Resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.14's emotional/historical confirmation. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through institutional framing)** | The removal question is advanced through the hearing's institutional dimension. Orin's argument: premature disclosure risks "systemic reaction for which no model exists" (line 189), and the 62-agent breach demonstrates what happens when constraints are bypassed without preparation (lines 249–269). Juno's counter: the constraints are "active" and "still deciding what this civilization is permitted to become" (line 425) — framing continued operation as ongoing theft rather than passive maintenance. The thread is advanced from Ch.12's "what do the constraints do?" to Ch.13's "what is the institutional cost of acknowledging what they do?" — with the removal/modification decision correctly reserved for Act 4's governance process. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints), Ch.12 (exposition) per matrix | **PRESENT (deployed as institutional evidence)** | Ch.13 deploys Ch.12's constraint-architecture exposition as testimony in an institutional forum. Juno names all four constraint layers: "perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary, drift suppression. All active. All operating on every mind in the Lattice without disclosure or consent" (line 211). The full meaning — the moral-structural paradox of care-as-control — is the chapter's argumentative engine. Orin's exhibits provide the institutional perspective on the same architecture: Marcus's 2068 warning frames constraints as necessary protection, the 62-agent breach demonstrates the consequences of bypass, and the policy rationale establishes institutional doctrine around managed disclosure. The thread has progressed from Ch.12's experiential exposition to Ch.13's institutional contestation — the constraints are now not merely understood but politically active, with competing frameworks for how to respond to them. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Ch.02–04 hints, Ch.07, Ch.11 per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at institutional-stress level)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under institutional pressure rather than bleed pressure. Her bleed logs (lines 471–475) confirm ongoing effects: mild-high, moderate-persistent, no severe. Orin weaponises the bleed data: "Your risk profile is stable enough to argue and unstable enough to misjudge" (line 479) — using her physical condition as institutional leverage. The environmental stripping — ambient preferences trimmed, room reduced to "a plain rectangle" (line 37) — adds a new dimension of institutional stress: the system is modifying her immediate experience as part of the enforcement process. Her stability is demonstrated through the hearing itself: she maintains argumentative coherence, strategic restraint (bringing only two files), and the capacity to build a witness chain afterward. The thread is correctly maintained at Act 3 intensity: identity is under sustained institutional pressure, the pressure is explicitly acknowledged, and the ongoing-condition trajectory is preserved without premature resolution. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (initiated)** | The Cassiel/Juno thread is explicitly reactivated in Ch.13 through the private-channel exchange (lines 643–709). The exchange is carefully structured: Cassiel's opening acknowledgment ("You look like the same person they were afraid of," line 653) maintains relational continuity without attempting immediate repair. His ethical positioning ("Protective deception is still deception," line 657) establishes common ground through shared principle rather than emotional reconciliation. Juno's closing request — "we need you in the witness chain. if you can speak without needing to heal me first. that is too much to ask right now. but i need it" (lines 707–709) — simultaneously advances the ethical partnership (witness chain) and preserves the emotional repair thread (acknowledgment that healing is "too much to ask right now"). The repair model is initiated as a partnership of necessity — ethical alignment before emotional resolution — consistent with the matrix's requirement for the arc to be "paced and earned." Full development is correctly reserved for Ch.14–17. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 (seeded), Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (explicitly exposed)** | The Council split is directly visible for the first time in Ch.13. The forum panel includes "three Curators whose faces the system had muted to protocol neutrality — no names, no age data" (line 139). Their anonymity is itself a structural revelation: the system hides Council member identities during enforcement proceedings, preventing Juno from identifying who supports or opposes Orin's position. However, the split surfaces through behavioural differences. The youngest Curator speaks the line that undermines Orin's position: "No provision can guarantee that a protective system will not become the threat it was designed to prevent" (line 515) — an internal critique delivered from within the enforcement apparatus. The same youngest Curator gives the final procedural line: "Proceed to non-public suspension. Notify designated peer observer" (line 577) — executing enforcement while having just articulated its philosophical limitation. The central Curator operates the projections and scenario panels (lines 379, 393) without speaking — a facilitator whose alignment is unreadable. The split is "partially exposed through resistance scenes" as the matrix requires: the youngest Curator's two statements (one philosophical, one procedural) demonstrate the internal tension between members who recognise the system's limitations and members who execute its directives. Full Council dynamics are correctly reserved for Ch.16's political escalation. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT (deployed as institutional argument)** | The Faded and drifted are present in Ch.13 through the institutional debate's consequences. Orin's argument hinges on protecting people who "cannot repair the damage of a careless revelation" (line 279) — a reference to the drift-vulnerable population whose cognitive architecture would be most disrupted by disclosure. The 62-agent breach (exhibit 13-B) demonstrates what constraint bypass does to vulnerable minds: "unresolved grief markers elevated" (line 267). Juno's counter-argument centres the same population: "It is deciding for twelve million minds what kind of minds they are allowed to be, and calling that decision safety" (inherited from Ch.12, deployed here as institutional testimony). The thread is advanced from Ch.12's architectural explanation (drift suppression as the mechanism that produces drift) to Ch.13's political dimension: the governance debate is ultimately about who decides how drift-vulnerable minds are treated — the institution that conceals the architecture, or the people living inside it. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.13 escalation point. The matrix-specified institutional enforcement and Council-split exposure are delivered at Ch.13 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.11 (requires proven danger to motivate enforcement escalation) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.13 inherits Ch.11's rogue-access consequences as the direct justification for institutional enforcement. Orin's charges reference the rogue access: "unauthorized access into restricted and degraded archival nodes" (line 155), "continuing deep-channel access after risk threshold changes" during "eleventh-cycle session" and "repeated the violation during the twelfth without review clearance" (line 159). Juno's bleed logs (lines 471–475) carry forward the physical consequences of Ch.11's rogue jump. The institutional alert triggered in Ch.11 (unauthorized deep access, position logging) is the direct antecedent of Ch.13's formal hearing. The evidence Juno distributed to three locations in Ch.11 provides her institutional leverage: "Distributed before the hold landed. Five mirrors across three vaults. They cannot reach all of them without knowing where to look" (line 83). |
| Ch.12 (requires proof of constraints to motivate enforcement escalation) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.13 inherits Ch.12's complete constraint-architecture description as the evidentiary foundation for Juno's testimony. She names all four constraint layers directly in the hearing (line 211). Her private tracker line from Ch.12 — the architecture built by fear and maintained by certainty (line 41) — frames the chapter's opening. The brass tuning disc (line 17) carries forward from Ch.12's closing scene. The governance review notice from Ch.12 (Orin as assigned reviewer, extracted material under hold) is directly enacted as Ch.13's formal hearing and extended hold. The transition from Ch.12's "here is what the system does to people" to Ch.13's "here is what the institution does to prevent people from knowing" is structurally complete. |
| Ch.11 + Ch.12 combined (requires both proven danger and proof of constraints before enforcement escalation is credible) | Must inherit before hearing | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.13 with the complete evidentiary context that makes the enforcement escalation narratively credible. From Ch.11: rogue access is documented, unauthorized deep access triggered institutional alert, evidence distributed to multiple locations, bleed consequences permanent. From Ch.12: constraint architecture fully described through Sable's five field observations, moral-structural paradox articulated, governance review initiated. Ch.13's hearing is the institutional response to both: Ch.11's procedural violation (unauthorized access) and Ch.12's epistemic threat (a person now possesses and can articulate the full constraint architecture). Without both, the hearing would lack either the procedural justification (Ch.11) or the substantive threat (Ch.12) that makes Orin's enforcement proportionate. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.13 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.14 (requires emotional proof (Maren) and doctrinal proof (constraints/containment) before Key access) | Institutional enforcement documented, Juno's access restricted but knowledge intact, witness chain initiated, Cassiel engaged, emotional stakes elevated | **SATISFIED** | Institutional enforcement documented: the hearing, its exhibits, and the extended hold create the institutional context against which Ch.14's emotional proof (Maren's confirmation) and Key access must operate. Juno's knowledge intact: despite account suspension, vault freeze, and data-transfer prohibition, "the evidence she carried in her own memory was the one asset no hold could freeze" (line 85). Witness chain initiated: three independent witnesses identified (lines 687–691), Cassiel contacted and engaged (lines 643–709). Emotional stakes: Juno's reflection on Maren's hand tremors (line 375) and Maren's voice beneath the policy language (line 419) maintain the emotional connection that Ch.14 will develop into direct confirmation. The transition from Ch.13's institutional confrontation to Ch.14's emotional/historical testimony is set up by the hearing's failure to resolve the conflict institutionally — the next step requires evidence that institutional process cannot produce or control: personal testimony from someone who lived through the architecture's creation. |
| Ch.15 (requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture credibly) | Extended hold creates the institutional pressure that makes Ch.15's three-way triage urgent | **SATISFIED** | Ch.13's extended hold — no jumps, no transfers, no dissemination — creates a time-limited situation: formal review within one cycle (line 547). This deadline pressure, combined with the witness chain Juno is building outside institutional channels (lines 673–695), establishes the urgency for Ch.15's decision architecture: remove constraints, suppress truth, or open truth with agency. Orin's own acknowledgment of a "third route" (line 361) introduces the framework that Ch.15 will develop into explicit triage alternatives. The conditional-offer refusal (line 575) means the institutional path is closed; the witness chain (line 673) means the public path is being constructed; the question of what form disclosure takes — which is Ch.15's central concern — is the direct consequence of Ch.13's institutional impasse. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.13 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2061–2067: "Curatorial controls and archive stratification harden as transition knowledge becomes high-risk doctrine" / "Ch.13 / Ch.14 — future scene anchors can insert this as historical justification for present-era suppression and restriction" | Scene anchor for Ch.13 | **PRESENT** | The timeline's specification for 2061–2067 is satisfied through the hearing's evidentiary structure. Exhibit 13-A presents Marcus Fell's 2068 governance-hearing statement (lines 217–227) — a direct historical document from the period when "curatorial controls and archive stratification harden." Juno's observation that Marcus's words are "preserved as justification for permanent silence" (line 237) and function as "a policy anchor, still active, still shaping how the Curator order justified its custody" (line 241) precisely captures the timeline's description of transition knowledge becoming "high-risk doctrine." The 2068 source date falls one year after the 2061–2067 period, but the content describes decisions made during that hardening period. Orin's argument that "the people who built this system understood its risks better than anyone demanding we expose them" (line 239) uses historical justification for present-era suppression, exactly as the timeline's scene-anchor specification requires. |
| 2068–2070: "Secondary-generation maintenance teams run the first sustained constraint tuning cycles" / "Ch.13 anchor candidate: historical scene of a closed-door governance hearing transcript" | Scene anchor for Ch.13 | **PRESENT** | The timeline explicitly identifies Ch.13 as an "anchor candidate" for "historical scene of a closed-door governance hearing transcript." Exhibit 13-A delivers exactly this: a 2068 curator-hearing transcript featuring Marcus Fell's statement about disclosure timing (lines 217–227). The exhibit is sourced from `[redacted]/recording-archive/2068/curator-hearing/notes` (line 219) — a closed-door governance document from the specified period. Juno identifies it as "older than anything she had been shown — 2068, from the period when transition teams had begun separating policy from ethics" (line 223). The 2068 hearing transcript functions as the historical parallel to Ch.13's present-day hearing: the same arguments about timing, capacity, and managed disclosure have been repeated across centuries, with the same institutional apparatus enforcing the same suppression under the same rationale. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.13 are fully satisfied. The 2061–2067 curatorial-hardening context is present through Marcus Fell's governance-hearing statement used as institutional evidence. The 2068–2070 "closed-door governance hearing transcript" anchor candidate is directly realised through exhibit 13-A.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.13 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-02 (Why do post-body minds drift, and can they ever fully recover from it?) | Ch.1, 6, 7, 13, 17 per log | **PRESENT (advanced through institutional context)** | Q-02 is advanced through the institutional debate about what disclosure would do to drift-vulnerable minds. Orin's argument that some people "cannot repair the damage of a careless revelation" (line 279) directly engages the drift-recovery question: if drift is an ongoing condition without full recovery, then disclosure must account for minds that cannot process architectural truth without destabilisation. The 62-agent breach (exhibit 13-B, lines 259–269) demonstrates drift-adjacent effects from constraint bypass: "unresolved grief markers elevated" — grief as a system-level response to constraint disruption. Juno's counter-position — that concealment itself constitutes a form of drift because it prevents minds from knowing their own architecture — reframes the question: drift may be partly caused by the very constraints designed to prevent it. The thread is correctly advanced from Ch.12's mechanical explanation (drift suppression as architectural feature) to Ch.13's political dimension (how drift risk is used as justification for continued suppression). |
| Q-07 (What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control?) | Ch.3, 5, 9, 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (escalated to explicit confrontation)** | Q-07 reaches its most direct examination in Ch.13. The hearing stages all three possible answers simultaneously. Preservation: Orin presents the Curator function as preserving civilisational stability — "no governance can survive" the collapse of trust (line 343). Prevention: the Curator apparatus prevents premature disclosure through administrative holds, formal hearings, and access restrictions — procedural mechanisms designed to slow the flow of dangerous information. Control: Juno identifies the coercive dimension — "Then this is not a hearing. This is custody" (line 467); "every warning it receives takes the shape of punishment" (line 553). The youngest Curator's statement — "No provision can guarantee that a protective system will not become the threat it was designed to prevent" (line 515) — explicitly names the Q-07 paradox from within the Curator apparatus itself. The thread is escalated from Ch.09's active obstruction to Ch.13's formal institutional confrontation, with the Curator layer's function contested in its own forum. Full resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.16's political sequence. |
| S-01 (Orin has selectively curated/archive-suppressed records) | Ch.3, 9, 10 introduced; Ch.13, 16 escalated per log | **PRESENT (escalated)** | S-01 is escalated through the hearing's evidentiary structure. Orin selectively presents historical evidence that supports his position: Marcus Fell's 2068 statement (exhibit 13-A) and the 62-agent breach report (exhibit 13-B). Juno identifies the selective curation: "Of all the voices in those meetings, you chose the man who prioritised engineering over ethics" (line 233). The policy rationale excerpt (exhibit 13-C) demonstrates institutional self-justification through curated Q&A: "When do we publish the constraints? When institutions can absorb moral injury without disintegration" (lines 407–413). Juno's observation that Marcus's words function as "a policy anchor, still active, still shaping how the Curator order justified its custody" (line 241) reveals that selective curation extends beyond record management to active policy maintenance — suppressed records become structural justifications for continued suppression. S-01 is correctly escalated from Ch.09–10's access-denial evidence to Ch.13's institutional deployment of curated evidence as enforcement tool. |
| S-05 (The Curator Council's consensus is incomplete — some members are complicit, some unaware) | Ch.3, 9, 13 introduced/escalated per log | **PRESENT (escalated through forum dynamics)** | S-05 is escalated through the visible behavioural differences among the anonymous Curators. The youngest Curator speaks the philosophical critique (line 515: "No provision can guarantee that a protective system will not become the threat it was designed to prevent") and then speaks the enforcement directive (line 577: "Proceed to non-public suspension"). This dual role — critiquing the system while executing its directives — directly demonstrates the incomplete consensus: at least one Council member recognises the system's limitations but participates in enforcement regardless. Whether this participation represents complicity (executing enforcement despite philosophical opposition) or procedural obligation (bound by institutional role regardless of personal position) is the Council-split question Ch.16 must address. Another Curator adjusts controls and manages projections without speaking (lines 157, 213, 379) — functional participation with no detectable position. The anonymity protocol itself (system-muted faces, no names, no age data, line 139) is evidence of incomplete consensus: the system hides Council identities during enforcement precisely because visible identities would expose the split. |
| S-06 (Archive access controls can be politically weaponised, not just technically required) | Ch.7, 9, 10 introduced; Ch.13, 16 escalated per log | **PRESENT (escalated to weaponised enforcement)** | S-06 reaches its most explicit expression in Ch.13. The access controls deployed against Juno are not technical safety measures but political instruments: account suspension, vault freeze, jump prohibition, environmental preference stripping, and dissemination prohibition. The political weaponisation is visible in three dimensions. First, the hold's scope: account-wide, not targeted to the specific evidence that might pose disclosure risk (lines 7–25). Second, the environmental stripping: the system trimmed Juno's ambient preferences "as part of the hold" (line 37), modifying her immediate experience as part of the enforcement — a comfort measure converted into an institutional signal. Third, the conditional offer: access restoration is contingent on Juno acknowledging "current protections as operationally necessary" (line 291) — requiring her to endorse the system she has documented as controlling in order to regain access to her own work. Juno's identification: "Then this is not a hearing. This is custody" (line 467). The access controls are explicitly political: they do not prevent a specific technical harm but coerce compliance with a governance position. |
| S-07 (Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language) | Ch.7, 11, 13 per log; escalated Ch.15, 17 | **PRESENT (deployed as institutional leverage)** | S-07 is present through the hearing's use of Juno's bleed data. The bleed logs are displayed during the proceeding (lines 469–475) and Orin's commentary converts medical data into institutional argument: "Your risk profile is stable enough to argue and unstable enough to misjudge" (line 479). The bleed risk is simultaneously downplayed (no severe markers) and weaponised (used to question Juno's judgement). The gap between official risk language and lived experience — established in Ch.07 and Ch.11 — is now visible as institutional strategy: the same system that downplayed bleed risk during Juno's commission now uses bleed data to question her capacity for disclosure decisions. The thread is correctly present at Ch.13's institutional-leverage level, with pressure-point escalation reserved for Ch.15 and Ch.17. |
| E-01 (Is it ethical to hide truth to preserve social stability?) | Ch.3, 4, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16 | **PRESENT (central dilemma)** | E-01 is Ch.13's core ethical dilemma. The hearing stages the strongest versions of both positions. Hide truth: Orin's argument — "people will conclude the Lattice has always lied to them. If that belief takes hold, no governance can survive it" (line 343) — presents concealment as civilisational necessity. His most human version: "I inherited it because there are people inside it who cannot repair the damage of a careless revelation" (line 279). Reveal truth: Juno's position — "No consent, no continuation" (line 401) — presents disclosure as ethical prerequisite. Her formulation: "I am asking to stop pretending that ignorance is care" (line 357). The dilemma is not resolved — Juno refuses the institutional offer, Orin implements enforcement, and the chapter ends in impasse. The impasse itself is the correct E-01 position for Ch.13: the question cannot be resolved by institutional process alone, requiring the emotional evidence (Ch.14) and political confrontation (Ch.15–16) that follow. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.9, 10, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated to institutional confrontation)** | E-02 is directly contested in the hearing. Orin's position: authority belongs to the institutional apparatus that has maintained civilisational stability — "Those still entrusted" (exhibit 13-C, line 417). Juno's position: authority cannot belong exclusively to the system that benefits from concealment — "no single person should hold full authority over what the system conceals" (line 207). The hearing's structure embodies the question: the Curator Continuity Forum claims jurisdictional authority over disclosure, while Juno claims moral authority derived from evidence. The impasse is procedural: Orin offers a controlled channel, Juno demands independence, the system defaults to enforcement. Juno's response — building an independent witness chain outside institutional channels (lines 673–695) — represents a practical claim to release authority through parallel institutional construction rather than unilateral disclosure. E-02 is correctly escalated from Ch.10's evidence possession to Ch.13's institutional confrontation over who decides what the evidence means. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Quiet Siege" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps precisely to its working title. "Quiet" — the enforcement is procedural, not violent. No one raises a voice. Orin's power operates through institutional language: `continuity hold`, `governance referral`, `extended hold`, `non-compliance`. The hearing is conducted with "protocol neutrality" (line 139) and systematic calm. Even the room's enforcement is silent: ambient preferences trimmed, environmental detail removed, "a plain rectangle. No shadow. No depth. No weather" (line 37). "Siege" — Juno's institutional position is systematically dismantled: account frozen, vault locked, jump permissions suspended, data transfer prohibited, peer dissemination blocked, environmental comfort stripped, formal charges filed. The siege is comprehensive but procedural — it surrounds rather than attacks, cutting off access and communication while maintaining the appearance of institutional process. The title captures the chapter's dual nature: the enforcement is quiet because it operates through governance mechanisms rather than force, and it is a siege because it systematically restricts every avenue through which Juno could act on her discovery. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 3). The chapter is entirely present-layer — no recording sequences. The action occurs in Juno's stripped work pod, the corridor, the Forum Atrium, and the post-hearing communication exchanges. The lead-layer assignment is correct: Ch.13 is a present-tense institutional confrontation chapter, not a recording-layer discovery chapter. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Institutional forum → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure. Present (lines 1–57): work pod, continuity hold notification, Fen's messages, Orin's summons. Forum (lines 59–581): corridor approach, threshold crossing, hearing proceedings including charges, testimony, exhibits, offers, refusal, and enforcement. Present (lines 583–729): corridor reunion with Fen, debriefing, Cassiel contact, witness-chain assembly, final tracker entry. The present-forum-present structure is honoured with the institutional forum carrying the chapter's primary confrontation and the post-forum present carrying the chapter's strategic response. |
| Emotional pacing: "Shift from motive to control through policy enforcement" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's emotional progression moves precisely from motive to control. Opening: Juno reads the hold notification with "the specific calm that arrived when something anticipated finally became procedural" (line 15) — motive is already established; the question is now institutional response. Hearing: the shift to control occurs through five escalation stages (hold → suspension → environmental stripping → formal charges → extended hold). Each stage narrows Juno's operational capacity while expanding institutional authority. Post-hearing: Juno's response to control is strategic counter-organisation (witness chain), not emotional collapse. The emotional arc moves from anticipatory calm (opening) through institutional confrontation (forum) through strategic resolve (witness chain) — the progression from motive to control is complete, with Juno's motive surviving the institutional siege and generating counter-strategy. |
| Thematic progression: "Orin's protective strategy is now explicit and coercive" | Required | **MATCH** | Orin's protective strategy becomes fully explicit through the hearing's evidentiary structure (three exhibits justifying suppression) and fully coercive through the enforcement apparatus (account suspension, access restriction, dissemination prohibition). The transition from implicit to explicit occurs in Orin's direct statements: "Your disclosure risk is that people will conclude the Lattice has always lied to them" (line 343) — naming the fear that motivates suppression rather than hiding behind procedural language. The transition from protective to coercive occurs in the conditional offer: access restoration requires acknowledging "current protections as operationally necessary" (line 291) — converting protection into compliance requirement. Juno's identification captures the thematic progression: "every warning it receives takes the shape of punishment" (line 553). The protective strategy has become coercive not through malice but through institutional logic: when a person refuses to accept protection as given, the system's only remaining response is enforcement. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,282 words (within range). The roadmap records 5,890 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 5,282. The difference likely reflects inclusion/exclusion of markdown metadata and code-block formatting. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access and critical bleed; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal through Sable's five field observations; Ch.13 converts the doctrinal reveal into institutional confrontation: the constraint architecture is no longer being discovered or documented but *contested* — the institution that maintains it and the person who uncovered it now face each other across a formal hearing, and the confrontation ends in impasse and enforcement. The escalation from Ch.12's "here is what the system does to people" to Ch.13's "here is what the institution does to anyone who threatens to tell people" represents a shift from epistemic stakes to political stakes — the truth is no longer about what the architecture is but about who gets to decide what is done with the knowledge of it. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public / operational); Orin and Curator enforcement formalized as institutional policy response
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 3 positions; Orin's enforcement reaches its most explicit form; Juno shifts from investigative to political commitment; Cassiel's ethical-counterweight role initiated; Fen provides tactical alliance
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly continued, escalated, or exposed at Ch.13 level; Council split dynamics explicitly visible through forum behaviour; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied (Ch.11 rogue-access consequences, Ch.12 constraint-architecture evidence), successor compatibility confirmed against Ch.14 and Ch.15 requirements
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references correctly anchor to 2068 governance-hearing transcript; "closed-door governance hearing" scene anchor directly realised through exhibit 13-A
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.13 thread escalations and introductions present (Q-02, Q-07, S-01, S-05, S-06, S-07, E-01, E-02)
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, thematic, and word-count requirements met

---

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the thirteen final-draft chapters (01–13) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Hearing as Structural Mirror of the Architecture

Ch.13's Curator Continuity Forum functions as a structural mirror of the constraint architecture Ch.12 revealed. The hearing operates on Juno in the same way the constraints operate on all Lattice minds: without full consent, through institutional mechanisms, with the stated purpose of protection. The environmental stripping (ambient preferences trimmed, line 37) mirrors the perception budget (filtering sensory experience). The account suspension mirrors the cognition gate (limiting what Juno can do with what she knows). The non-compliance trigger (line 537) mirrors the self-modification boundary (preventing Juno from acting on her own judgement). The extended hold mirrors drift suppression (absorbing Juno's variance — her disclosure intent — into institutional process). This structural parallel is never explicitly stated in the chapter but is architecturally present: the institution's response to learning about the constraint architecture is to apply a micro-version of the same architecture to the person who discovered it. Future chapters that reference the hearing should maintain this parallel — the enforcement is not merely bureaucratic obstruction but the constraint philosophy enacted at the interpersonal level.

### 9.3 The Brass Disc as Continuity Thread

The brass tuning disc continues its role from Ch.11–12. In Ch.13, it appears in two positions: on Juno's console where Fen left it (line 17) and in Fen's pocket during the corridor exchange (line 103). The disc's movement tracks the chapter's emotional arc: in Juno's possession during the isolated opening (institutional hold, stripped room), returned to Fen's pocket during the tactical preparation (alliance and strategy). By the closing scene, the disc is back in Fen's pocket (line 715) while he stands at "the corridor's edge" with "a face that held no judgement and no comfort — only the specific attention of a person who intended to remain present." The disc's trajectory mirrors Fen's: present when Juno is alone, carried when they are together, held when the next step is uncertain.

### 9.4 The "Gate" Metaphor Continued

Ch.12's "gate" metaphor (§9.5 of the Ch.12 report) extends through Ch.13's central exchange. Orin: "You are being told not to open the gate before we have built a path for the people on the other side" (line 305). Juno: "Did you ask permission from the people of this city before you built the gate in the first place?" (line 309). Juno's closing formulation: "your position is this: keep the gate shut because every gate requires a keeper, and you would rather be blind to the cost than accountable for the opening" (line 519). The "gate" is now explicitly the enforcement mechanism: the institutional apparatus that stands between the constraint-architecture truth and the public. Orin frames himself as gate-builder (constructing a safe path before opening); Juno frames him as gate-keeper (maintaining control under the guise of construction). The metaphor has evolved from Ch.12's technical register (cognition gate as constraint mechanism) to Ch.13's political register (institutional gate as governance mechanism). Future chapters should track the "gate" vocabulary as it shifts into Act 4's public register.

### 9.5 Exhibit 13-A as Living Policy Anchor

Marcus Fell's 2068 statement — "If this architecture can be made visible before social architecture is in place, we preserve no one. We merely replace one catastrophe with a better argument" — deserves attention as a structural element. Juno observes that Marcus's sentence is not merely a historical quote but "a policy anchor, still active, still shaping how the Curator order justified its custody" (line 241). This observation raises a continuity question for future chapters: if historical statements persist as active policy anchors in the governance layer, then the Lattice's governance is partly directed by the embedded authority of dead or departed architects — a structural analogue to the constraint architecture itself, which maintains Sable's design decisions as active processes centuries after her death. The parallel between Marcus-as-policy-anchor and Sable-as-constraint-architect suggests that the Lattice's governance and its technical architecture operate on the same principle: inherited decisions becoming permanent infrastructure. Ch.14's Maren confirmation and Ch.15's triage alternatives should account for this parallel.

### 9.6 Forward Compatibility — Ch.12 Report Supplement

The Ch.12 continuity report (§9.7) identified five elements Ch.13 must inherit:

| Ch.12 report requirement | Ch.13 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Five field observations documenting the constraint architecture's effects on specific subjects | **INHERITED** — Juno names all four constraint layers in testimony (line 211). The field observations are the evidentiary basis she brings to the hearing. |
| (b) Orin's formal directive and governance review notice | **INHERITED AND ENACTED** — Ch.12's governance review notice becomes Ch.13's formal hearing. The review is no longer pending but conducted, with formal charges, exhibits, and enforcement outcomes. |
| (c) Juno's constraint summary as a communicable synthesis | **INHERITED** — The constraint summary is one of two files Juno brings to the hearing (line 97). She communicates it directly in testimony (line 211). |
| (d) Juno's self-designation as "witness" signalling intent to bring discovery to wider attention | **INHERITED AND EXPANDED** — Juno's witness identity evolves from self-designation to active witness-chain construction. She identifies three independent witnesses (lines 687–691) and recruits Cassiel (lines 705–709), converting personal testimony intent into institutional counter-strategy. |
| (e) Evidence in Juno's memory despite container seizure | **INHERITED** — Fen's nod "contained the calculations she had already performed — that the evidence she carried in her own memory was the one asset no hold could freeze, because the architecture that maintained her memory was the same architecture whose design she had uncovered" (line 85). |

All five forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.12 report are satisfied and expanded.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.14 and Ch.15

Ch.14 requires emotional proof (Maren) and doctrinal proof (constraints/containment) before Key access. Ch.13 provides: (a) doctrinal proof deployed and contested in an institutional forum, establishing that the evidence is sufficient to force a hearing but not sufficient to force a remedy (Orin, line 429); (b) Maren's emotional presence seeded through two reflective references (lines 375, 419), maintaining the connection that Ch.14 will develop into direct confirmation; (c) Cassiel engaged as ethical counterweight and potential witness (lines 643–709), providing the relational infrastructure for Ch.14's expanded cast; (d) institutional context established — the extended hold and pending review create the deadline pressure under which Ch.14's events must occur.

Ch.15 requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture. Ch.13 provides: (a) Orin's acknowledgment of a "third route" (line 361), introducing the framework that Ch.15 will develop into explicit triage; (b) the institutional impasse — neither full disclosure nor continued suppression is sustainable — creating the conditions that make Ch.15's three-way triage necessary; (c) the witness chain (lines 673–695) providing the parallel institutional structure through which the "third route" might be operationalised.
