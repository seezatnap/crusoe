## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-17.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-17.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 17 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome matrix: mixed futures, Maren closure, and post-surprise Lattice baseline | **PRESENT** | Ch.17 delivers all three elements across its full arc. **Outcome matrix / mixed futures:** The chapter presents three divergent district-level responses that constitute a distributed outcome matrix rather than a single resolution. District four conducts the city's first supervised modification trial — a 12% reduction in the perception budget's sensory-recall filter under continuous monitoring with three volunteers, one of whom withdraws as temporarily unstable (lines 43–61). District nine petitions for all existing constraints to remain active for a minimum ninety-day review period (lines 63–75). District eleven takes neither position, instead opening a documentation wall with the question "who guards a choice when everyone is told they are now guard and guarded?" (lines 77–79). These three patterns — cautious experimentation, principled retention, and irreducible philosophical uncertainty — represent the mixed-futures outcome the matrix requires. No single resolution is declared correct. By evening, further citizen entries confirm the distributed outcome: a father retaining all constraints while his daughter requests reduced dream lock (line 507), a woman reporting her husband sleeping better after choosing no change (line 509), an engineer testing a narrowed profile who "think[s] faster" but "weep[s] for names I cannot place" (line 511). The outcome is not convergence but co-existence. **Maren closure:** The central emotional sequence (lines 211–381) delivers Maren's final lucid appearance. She communicates through drift-fragmented speech — `open is a blade / you did not cut carefully first` (lines 287–289), `I chose silence because I had seen minds split and no one came back whole` (lines 309–311), `you carry by not carrying only one thing at once` (line 329), and the final request: `do not make me return to your certainty by forcing my answer into one sentence / say less / stay with what is true and unfinished` (lines 345–349). Her form thins until the room's ambient field carries more of her weight than her own coherence (line 339), and she exits with the instruction `go back / light` (lines 369–371). The farewell holds no ritual, no collapse, no final certainty — only "an elder presence that had outlived the language for itself" (line 377). **Post-surprise Lattice baseline:** The chapter's closing sequence (lines 549–629) establishes the post-disclosure Lattice baseline. The city has not collapsed, reformed, or returned to status quo. It holds "all of them — the cautious, the daring, the frightened, the stubborn, the newly honest, the still afraid of honesty" (line 623). Juno posts the phase-two options — no-change pilot zones, mixed audit zones, optional modification test lanes — all voluntary, all with immediate withdrawal (lines 481–493). The new baseline is informed uncertainty: "No one had all of it. She did not. That was the point" (lines 625–629). |
| Reveal status: "Public / emotional resolution" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter operates entirely at the public / emotional-resolution level. The disclosure is no longer being debated, contested, or distributed — it is being lived with. The public dimension is present in the 14,206 new submissions (line 9), the 3,118 pending translation requests (line 11), the 412 grief support queue entries (line 13), and the district-level civic processes. The emotional-resolution dimension is present in Maren's farewell (the relational thread), Orin's single-word response `heard` (line 577) acknowledging transformation without surrender, Cassiel's wordless message linking to children's questions (lines 583–585), and Juno's final recognition that "sufficiency was not available and silence was no longer an option" (line 31). The reveal status has progressed from Ch.15's public-strategic through Ch.16's public-political to Ch.17's public / emotional resolution — the correct terminal position. The matrix specifies this reveal "Closes disclosed threads and maps what remains legitimately uncertain," and Ch.17 delivers exactly this: Maren's thread is closed through farewell, the civic-governance thread is mapped through three district responses, and the uncertainty is explicitly preserved: "She did not know whether the architecture had improved" (line 611). |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.17 is present at the correct reveal status (public / emotional resolution). The chapter delivers mixed-futures outcome matrix, Maren's emotional closure, and the post-disclosure Lattice baseline. Disclosed threads are closed; legitimate uncertainty is mapped and preserved.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She resolves the epistemic burden by exposing design truth without collapsing the polity, and chooses a constrained-but-transparent path instead of suppression or dissolution | **PRESENT (completed — final resolution)** | Ch.17 completes Juno's Act 4 arc by demonstrating the constrained-but-transparent path in operation. The chapter opens with Juno working through the aftermath of disclosure — 14,206 submissions, 3,118 translation requests, 412 grief support entries (lines 9–13). She responds to citizen queries by hand (line 27), refusing to delegate to institutional templates because "the institutional templates could not carry the weight of what people were actually asking" (line 95). The polity has not collapsed: district four is experimenting cautiously, district nine is retaining constraints deliberately, district eleven is holding open philosophical inquiry (lines 43–79). Juno's evening update codifies the constrained-but-transparent path into three phase-two options — no-change pilot zones, mixed audit zones, optional modification test lanes — all voluntary, all with immediate withdrawal, all publicly documented (lines 481–493). The final sentence of her public posting — "no citizen required to choose before the city can hold one more day of uncertainty" (line 493) — articulates the resolution: the path is constrained (no forced modification), transparent (all participation publicly documented), and consent-based (voluntary, revocable). The epistemic burden is resolved not through a single act of disclosure but through the daily labour of responding, translating, and holding uncertainty without forcing resolution. |
| Obsession resolved into responsibility | **COMPLETED** | Juno's obsession — which progressed from curiosity (Ch.01) through fixation (Ch.04) through rogue access (Ch.11) through institutional defiance (Ch.13) through lineage inheritance (Ch.14) through public testimony (Ch.15) through civic implementation (Ch.16) — reaches its final form in Ch.17 as sustained civic responsibility. She types responses by hand (line 27). She walks through three neighbourhoods before noon with relay panels under her arm (lines 95–96). She sits in district-eleven's square and "listened without a queue" (line 523). She copies entries by hand onto her writing slate (line 591). The obsession has been completely transmuted: what remains is not personal fixation but the daily work of a person who has accepted that the truth she pursued is now the city's to hold, and that her role is to keep the infrastructure of honesty operational. Her three closing messages — to Cassiel about stopping the pretence that safety requires denying uncertainty (lines 561–563), to Fen about plain wording for support terms (lines 565–567), to Orin about shared responsibility (lines 569–571) — are operational instructions, not personal vindication. The obsession is absent; the responsibility is permanent. |
| Risk: obsession resolved too cleanly | **NO VIOLATION** | The resolution is not clean. Juno's responses feel "insufficient" — "Every response felt insufficient. She sent it anyway, because sufficiency was not available" (line 31). She holds contradictory outcomes "in the same body without forcing them into sequence" (line 81). She does not know whether the architecture has improved, whether Maren said what she thought she heard, whether district nine will hold, whether district four will pull back (lines 611–612). The Maren farewell is devastating rather than redemptive — Maren's final words are fragmented instructions from a dissolving mind, not a blessing or an absolution (lines 365–371). Juno's closing position is explicitly "neither triumph nor release" (line 623). The city has not become kind (implicit in the "mixed" status, line 15); it has become honest. The emotional cost is measured in the work itself: a person who slept two hours in thirty-one (line 7), who walks neighbourhoods carrying relay panels, who copies entries by hand at midnight. The resolution is earned but exhausting, not clean. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Faces public and moral costs of long-term custodial deception but is not demonized as purely villainous | **PRESENT (completed — final institutional position)** | Orin appears in Ch.17 across three structural positions. **First — the corridor confrontation** (lines 125–199): he arrives with a box of governance records from the first sixty years of constraint implementation — documents he has never shown to anyone outside the senior Curator archive (line 197). His arrival is physically grounded: he holds the box "the way a person holds evidence they have spent centuries deciding whether to destroy" (line 127). His argument is neither capitulation nor resistance: "I have worked where institutions did not admit uncertainty. The first response is always to insist that risk is an argument against all action" (line 157). He acknowledges both that the disclosure is necessary and that its consequences are unpredictable: "I am watching a city try to carry it together. I do not know if the structure will hold" (line 161). His most revealing statement is defensive without being dishonest: "Stop speaking as though I chose deception out of convenience. I chose it because I had watched what happened to people who were given everything at once" (line 175). He then opens his archive to the public, an act that is simultaneously surrender and institutional transformation: "If you are going to ask the city to carry this, the city should know what it is carrying" (line 197). **Second — the cautious endorsement** (lines 495–504): his response to Juno's phase-two options is measured and institutional — "this process is structurally volatile / proceed with witness-led channels / monitor for coercive dynamics / all interventions must remain public" (lines 497–503). This is neither endorsement nor resistance but operational engagement. **Third — the single-word reply** (line 577): Juno's message — "if the city does not hold this then none of us held it" — receives `heard`. No thanks, no agreement, no resistance. Juno interprets this as "the sound a person makes when the institution they spent centuries protecting has been asked to become something they cannot yet recognise, and they are choosing to remain present for the transformation rather than resist it" (line 579). Orin is not demonised: his archive release is an act of moral courage. He is not redeemed: his caution persists through institutional language. He remains present — the most difficult position for a person whose authority has been publicly dismantled and who has chosen to witness rather than depart. |
| No overexposure of intentions — moral ambiguity preserved | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain layered in Ch.17. His archive release is simultaneously an act of transparency and a positioning manoeuvre — by providing the historical governance records, he claims a role in shaping how the city interprets the constraint era. His cautious endorsement (lines 497–503) is simultaneously principled caution and institutional self-preservation. His `heard` (line 577) is simultaneously acknowledgement, restraint, and strategic patience. The chapter preserves the core ambiguity that has operated since Ch.03: Orin is a person whose protective instincts and institutional identity are not separable, and the difficulty of separating them is what makes his character compelling. Ch.17 does not resolve this ambiguity — it leaves him present and participating in a process he did not choose and cannot fully control. |

### 2.3 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Serves as final emotional referendum on whether truth can be held without breaking relational love | **PRESENT (completed — final farewell)** | Maren's Ch.17 appearance is the novel's central emotional closure. She arrives through two registers. **First — the summons** (lines 211–229): her message arrives through the private relay with the drift-imposed fragmentation that has characterised her communications across Act 4 — `if you can still visit, come before evening drift / I can hold clear once more` (lines 219–221). She has timed her lucidity for Juno's visit: "She had timed her lucidity the way she had always timed everything: not for drama, but for precision" (line 229). **Second — the farewell** (lines 249–381): the room holds no projection lights, only a memory aperture Maren kept "because she believed frames were how people remembered they were looking" (line 253). Maren's form is described as "edges soft, form wavering like light through water that was not water" (line 267). Her voice arrives as "two versions of itself and then resolved into one" (line 271). The farewell delivers the emotional referendum through six exchanges: (a) Maren's observation that disclosure was a blade, requiring purpose in its cutting (lines 287–293); (b) her confession that she chose silence because she had watched minds split (lines 309–311); (c) her acknowledgement that now Juno can "choose with others" (line 323); (d) her instruction to "carry by not carrying only one thing at once" (line 329); (e) her final request — "do not make me return to your certainty by forcing my answer into one sentence / say less / stay with what is true and unfinished" (lines 345–349); (f) her last words — "you do not keep me with promises / you keep me by remembering what I held together for a while" (lines 355–357). The referendum's answer: truth has not broken relational love. It has transformed it from a shared secret into a shared instruction — Maren's legacy is not the secret she kept but the way she asks Juno to carry what follows. Juno holds the brass disc at the door (line 379) and understands: "Maren did not ask to be remembered exactly. She asked to be carried honestly" (line 381). The relational bond survives not because truth was painless but because love's final expression is an instruction for how to live with what truth costs. |
| Drift progression consistent | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's drift progression reaches its terminal point in Ch.17. The progression across Act 4: Ch.14's extended four-register confession (sustained lucidity for a single act of transfer), Ch.15's compressed three-line message (lucidity permits only essential words), Ch.16's two exchanges (tactical counsel and one-line response), Ch.17's final visit (drift markers elevated, coherence index unstable, spoken thread retrieval partial — lines 257–261). In Ch.17, Maren's communication arrives in fragmented phrases — `open is a blade` (line 287), `if not cut carefully then cut for purpose` (line 293) — each one "a small act of concentration" consistent with the established pattern. Her form thins progressively during the visit: first visible as a wavering shape (line 267), then as two versions resolving into one (line 271), then as a face that "brightened by one impossible fraction — the closest thing to a smile the drift still permitted — and then dissolved into two versions again" (line 333), then as a field "too thin to sustain conversation" (line 363), and finally as a single repeating line — `good / juno / go back / light` (lines 365–371) — before becoming "nothing she could parse" (line 373). The drift does not reverse, pause, or conveniently stabilise for dramatic purposes. Each utterance costs more than the last. The terminal point — presence without parseable language — is the natural conclusion of the trajectory established across sixteen prior chapters. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps convert revelation into a communal practice of living with uncertainty | **PRESENT (completed — final relational and civic position)** | Cassiel appears in Ch.17 across two registers. **Civic translation work** (lines 435–473): he arrives from a translation run at dusk with "no dramatic air at all" (line 435). His dialogue with Juno centres on a child's question about who gets to define what her mind can do (lines 441–457). His response — "You do not have to know" (line 457) — articulates the communal practice the matrix requires: living with uncertainty is not requiring answers but maintaining the space where questions can be asked. His calm "did something more practical than solving. It held the space open long enough for the next breath to arrive" (line 459). He reads the status report — no panic, no mass rollback, no forced reversals, no universal compliance — and smiles "not because the news was good, but because the news was real" (line 471). His observation — "No universal compliance means we are alive" (line 473) — converts the absence of resolution into evidence of civic health. **Wordless message** (lines 583–585): his closing contribution is a link to a school circle where children are writing the first questions for phase two — `if we can choose how much we can be, do we become less because we can be more?` (line 585). No header, no formatting. Cassiel's final act in the novel is to route children's questions to Juno — the communal practice made concrete: the next generation is already asking, and the adult role is to listen. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's Ch.17 engagement is the culmination of a correctly paced six-chapter progression: re-entry with distance (Ch.07), private ethical counsel (Ch.13), formal witness commitment (Ch.14), public hearing partnership (Ch.15), communal translation leadership (Ch.16), and relational/civic completion (Ch.17). His Ch.17 presence is characterised by absence of drama — "no dramatic air at all" (line 435), cups set beside each other (line 435), a quiet exchange about a child's question. The relationship with Juno is expressed through shared attention rather than reconciliation: "the specific quiet between two people who had once shared a life and now shared a purpose" (line 459). The emotional repair is not declared — it is demonstrated through the quality of co-presence. The arc's final position is correctly paced: Cassiel and Juno have moved from estrangement through ethical co-authorship to a partnership defined by shared purpose rather than recovered intimacy. |

### 2.5 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps stabilize outcomes at the social edge of public exposure and aftermath | **PRESENT (completed — final operational position)** | Fen appears in Ch.17 across four structural positions. **Morning briefing** (lines 39–87): he arrives with routing reports and presents three district-level response patterns — experimentation, retention, philosophical inquiry — providing the analytical framework Juno needs to understand the city's divergent responses. His observation — "Three responses. None of them wrong" (line 83) — names the distributed-outcome reality without trying to resolve it. **Neighbourhood work** (lines 95–119): he walks three neighbourhoods with Juno before noon, fixing relay panels and routing secondary channels through maintenance-level infrastructure (line 97). His characterisation — "It still sounds like we are inventing a new kind of bureaucracy" (line 99) — provides the practical-sceptical voice that prevents civic idealism from becoming abstract. **Maren threshold** (lines 235–245): he notices Juno's change in pace and provides the brass disc — "the old tuning charm, warm from his pocket" (line 241) — without explanation. His role at this threshold is precisely calibrated: he does not accompany Juno to Maren's room, does not ask what will happen, and provides only the object and the permission to cross. **Post-visit** (lines 387–397): his three-word exchange — "How long?" / "Long enough to know why this was the hardest visit" / "That is enough" — demonstrates the alliance's final register: he does not demand details, does not offer comfort, and acknowledges the visit's weight with the economy of a person who understands that some experiences require no interpretation. His closing message — four support terms, a routing suggestion, and one joke (line 581) — is the Fen signature: practical, operational, and human in the margins. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's concern in Ch.17 is expressed through sustained operational presence rather than alarm. He arrives with routing reports, walks neighbourhoods, fixes relay panels, provides the brass disc, waits outside Maren's room, and sends practical support terms. His emotional register is controlled: his face "suggested he had slept even less than she had" (line 39) — concern expressed through shared exhaustion rather than verbalised worry. The alliance is fully mature: Fen's Ch.17 position is the terminal state of a sixteen-chapter progression from external observer (Ch.01) through risk alarm (Ch.07) through full alliance (Ch.11) through infrastructure leadership (Ch.16) to operational partnership with personal depth (Ch.17). |

### 2.6 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core design ethics become emotionally legible and no longer only plot mechanism | **PRESENT (completed — ethics distributed to population)** | Sable does not appear by name in Ch.17. Her presence operates through the civic consequences of her design decisions, which have now been fully distributed to the population. **Through district four's trial** (lines 43–61): the supervised modification of the perception budget's sensory-recall filter — one of Sable's four constraint layers — produces both benefit ("improved temporal recall under emotional strain," line 53) and cost ("vivid sensory bleed from unresolved personal memory," line 55). The volunteer's note — "I remembered the sound of a door my grandmother closed forty years before I was archived. I did not know I had lost it" (line 59) — makes Sable's design ethics emotionally legible: the constraints prevented pain and prevented memory, and neither prevention was complete. **Through district nine's petition** (lines 63–75): the eight hundred and fourteen residents requesting constraint retention demonstrate that Sable's protective intent has living constituencies — people who experience the constraints as stability rather than limitation. **Through the citizen query** (lines 23–29): the 340-year-old resident's statement — "I am not angry. I am trying to understand what it means that I was comfortable" — makes Sable's design ethics personal: the architecture's success at creating comfort is now itself a subject of moral inquiry. Sable's ethics are no longer plot mechanism or doctrinal exposition — they are the lived experience of a city discovering that its architecture was built by someone who made decisions about their cognition without their consent, and who did so from a position of genuine care and genuine fear. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is preserved in Ch.17 through the city's divergent responses. As protector: district nine's petition and the 340-year resident's comfort demonstrate that the constraints provided real stability. The volunteer who withdraws from district four's trial demonstrates that constraint removal carries real risk. As limiter: the engineer who "think[s] faster" but "weep[s] for names I cannot place" (line 511) demonstrates that the constraints suppressed both danger and genuine experience. The child's question — "if we can choose how much we can be, do we become less because we can be more?" (line 585) — poses the protector/limiter tension in its most irreducible form: the constraints both diminished and preserved, and neither dimension resolves the other. The complexity is distributed to the population rather than resolved by the narrative. |

### 2.7 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Legitimacy is re-negotiated publicly; truth release challenge reframes Curator authority | **PRESENT (completed — authority redistributed through civic process)** | The Curator system's legitimacy reaches its final post-negotiation state in Ch.17. Orin's response to the phase-two options — "this process is structurally volatile / proceed with witness-led channels / monitor for coercive dynamics / all interventions must remain public" (lines 497–503) — represents the Curator system operating in its new mode: advisory rather than authoritative, present rather than controlling. The `heard` response (line 577) is the Curator system's terminal position in miniature: acknowledgement without endorsement, presence without direction. The two senior Curators who accompany Orin to the corridor meeting (line 127) are witnesses to his archive release, not enforcers — their presence validates the institutional transformation rather than resisting it. The city's phase-two framework — no-change zones, mixed audit zones, optional modification lanes — operates through witness-led channels that include Curator observers but do not require Curator approval (lines 481–493). The truth-release challenge has reframed Curator authority from custodial secrecy to institutional participation in a publicly visible governance process. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The Curator system in Ch.17 is neither villainous nor powerless. Orin's cautionary language — "structurally volatile" (line 497) — preserves institutional concern without institutional obstruction. His archive release (line 197) is an act of institutional transformation performed voluntarily. The two senior Curators are present but silent — institutional witnesses, not enforcers. The system's enforcement apparatus is absent from Ch.17: no compliance flags, no cautionary advisories, no legal phrases. The institutional apparatus has adapted to the post-disclosure environment by shifting from enforcement to participation, consistent with Ch.16's trajectory and preserving the Curator system as a legitimate governance structure rather than a defeated adversary. |

### 2.8 Faded/Drifted Legacy

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Marks the moral center of why transparency and consent, not fear, must drive Act 4 resolution | **PRESENT (completed — through Maren's farewell and civic consequences)** | The Faded/drifted legacy operates in Ch.17 through three registers. **Maren's terminal drift:** the novel's most sustained Faded/drifted sequence is the Maren farewell (lines 249–377), where drift is not abstraction but embodied farewell — a mind that has outlived its language, communicating through fragments that cost concentration, dissolving across the scene until only `good / juno / go back / light` remains. Maren's drift is the moral centre: the constraints were designed to prevent this kind of dissolution, and the constraints also prevented the informed consent that might have made the dissolution bearable. **The grief support queue:** the 412 grief support requests (line 13) demonstrate that the disclosure has activated the drift-affected population's support needs — people are engaging with the disclosure material and requesting help, not being protected from it. **The 340-year resident:** the citizen who has "lived for 340 years inside something I did not know had edges" (line 25) and who is "not angry" but "trying to understand what it means that I was comfortable" represents the Faded/drifted legacy at its most human: a person who has lived inside constraints long enough to experience them as the shape of their life, and who is now confronting the fact that the shape was chosen for them. The moral centre is articulated through the chapter's central theme: transparency and consent drive the resolution because the alternative — fear-based protection — produced Maren's silence, the 340-year resident's unknowing comfort, and the 412 grief support requests from people who have been living inside an architecture they were never told existed. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.17 match their matrix-specified Act 4 terminal positions. Juno completes the epistemic-burden resolution through sustained civic work. Orin faces moral costs and participates through archive release and cautious institutional engagement without demonization. Maren delivers the final emotional referendum through a farewell that transforms relational love from shared secrecy into shared instruction. Cassiel completes the communal-practice conversion through co-presence and children's questions. Fen completes social-edge stabilization through operational partnership. Sable's design ethics are emotionally legible through the population's lived experience. The Curator system's authority is redistributed. No premature closure, no missing character beats, no false resolution.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.17 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Final impact tested in Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (final impact delivered through farewell)** | Maren's fear of the Key — partially closed through Ch.14's confession, carried forward through Ch.15's three-line message and Ch.16's tactical counsel — reaches its final impact in Ch.17 through the farewell sequence. Her confession — `I chose silence because I had seen minds split and no one came back whole` (line 311) — articulates the fear at its most personal: she witnessed unconstrained cognition destroy people, and her silence was a response to that witnessing. Her subsequent acknowledgement — `I thought if you knew limits were chosen you would spend your life arguing with an absence / and arguing would become all you had` (lines 313–315) — reveals that the fear was not only about the Key's danger but about Juno's specific vulnerability: a fixated person given a target would become defined by the argument. The final impact is the transformation of fear into instruction: Maren's last request — `stay with what is true and unfinished` (line 349) — converts her fear into a standard for how to live with the truth she feared disclosing. The thread is fully resolved: the fear is explained (Ch.14), its strategic wisdom is deployed (Ch.15–16), and its emotional cost is witnessed in the farewell (Ch.17). The fear was justified, the silence was understandable, and neither justification absolves the cost. |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Mostly resolved Ch.13–14; final moral accounting in Ch.17 | **PRESENT (final moral accounting delivered)** | The Orin-suppression thread reaches its final moral position in Ch.17 through the corridor confrontation (lines 125–199). Orin's defence — "I chose it because I had watched what happened to people who were given everything at once" (line 175) — maintains the protective dimension. His archive release — sixty years of governance records he had "never shown to anyone outside the senior Curator archive" (line 197) — demonstrates that the suppression was not absolute: the institutional actor who maintained secrecy is now choosing transparency, suggesting that his suppression was always conditional rather than ideological. His `heard` response (line 577) completes the moral accounting: Orin has neither accepted blame nor claimed vindication. He has chosen to remain present for a transformation he did not initiate and cannot control. The final moral position is precisely the one the matrix requires: neither malicious nor purely protective, but institutionally entrenched and now publicly renegotiated. The suppression was protective in intent, harmful in consequence, and the person who maintained it is choosing to witness rather than resist its undoing. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Resolved through open-governance process in Act 4, not immediate binary verdict, per matrix | **PRESENT (resolved through distributed civic governance)** | The Key-removal question is resolved in Ch.17 through the distributed civic process the matrix specifies. The answer is neither "yes" nor "no" but "through witnessed, voluntary, reversible, publicly documented processes" — articulated through the phase-two options (lines 481–493): no-change pilot zones (constraints retained), mixed audit zones (community-defined review), and optional modification test lanes (supervised, reversible, publicly documented). District four's trial demonstrates that modification is possible but costly (lines 43–61). District nine's petition demonstrates that retention is a legitimate civic choice (lines 63–75). District eleven's documentation wall demonstrates that the question itself remains open and philosophically unresolvable (lines 77–79). The thread is resolved at Ch.17's governance level: the Key can be modified, but only through processes that distribute authority, preserve reversibility, and refuse to convert the question into a binary verdict. The "not immediate binary verdict" specification is explicitly honoured: Juno's phase-two language — "no citizen required to choose before the city can hold one more day of uncertainty" (line 493) — rejects binary resolution as a structural principle. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Core meaning resolved as moral/structural paradox in Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (resolved through lived civic experience)** | The full meaning of Sable's constraints is resolved in Ch.17 as the moral/structural paradox the matrix specifies. The paradox is demonstrated through three registers. **Structural:** district four's trial shows that modifying one constraint parameter produces both benefit (improved temporal recall) and cost (vivid sensory bleed, temporary instability) — the constraints are simultaneously protective and limiting at the infrastructural level. **Moral:** the volunteer's note — "I remembered the sound of a door my grandmother closed forty years before I was archived. I did not know I had lost it" (line 59) — captures the moral paradox: the constraint prevented both pain and beauty, and neither prevention was disclosed. The 340-year resident's comfort (line 25) demonstrates that the constraints' moral dimension is not resolvable through disclosure alone — the person was comfortable, and the comfort was real even though it was architecturally imposed. **Existential:** the child's question — "if we can choose how much we can be, do we become less because we can be more?" (line 585) — poses the paradox at its most irreducible: constraints that limit also define, and the removal of limits is not pure liberation but a transformation of identity. The core meaning is resolved as the matrix requires: Sable's constraints are a moral/structural paradox that cannot be resolved by choosing sides, only by building governance structures that let people hold both sides simultaneously. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Continues as ongoing character condition with no static cure, per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at post-disclosure level — no cure, ongoing condition)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under the sustained stress of post-disclosure civic work. She has slept two hours in thirty-one (line 7). She holds contradictory outcomes "in the same body without forcing them into sequence" (line 81). She visits Maren and witnesses a farewell she was "not ready for" (line 237). Her tears are described as "a slowing of pressure, a deceleration in the continuity layer" (line 325) — the ongoing bleed-adjacent experience that has characterised her condition since Ch.07. She does not know whether the architecture has improved (line 611). She does not know whether Maren's words were drift's invention (line 359). She steps out with "neither triumph nor release" (line 623). The identity-stability thread is correctly maintained at its terminal position: Juno is functioning under accumulated stress with no cure and no clean resolution. Her stability is demonstrated through sustained coherence across the full chapter's arc — civic work, Maren farewell, Orin confrontation, evening updates, midnight listening, dawn posting — but the cost is visible in the exhaustion, the insufficient responses, and the explicit acknowledgement that "No one had all of it. She did not" (lines 625–627). The ongoing-condition trajectory is preserved without premature cure. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Finalized in farewell sequence per matrix | **PRESENT (completed through co-presence and shared purpose)** | The Cassiel/Juno emotional repair reaches its final form in Ch.17 through the dusk exchange (lines 435–473) and the closing message (lines 583–585). The repair is expressed through quality of attention rather than declaration: "the specific quiet between two people who had once shared a life and now shared a purpose" (line 459). Cassiel's observation — "You do not have to know" (line 457) — and Juno's admission — "I do not know if I can" (line 455) — demonstrate the repair's character: not certainty restored but uncertainty shared. His smile at the real news (line 471) and his "No universal compliance means we are alive" (line 473) articulate the ethical partnership's terminal register: truth is valued not because it produces good outcomes but because it produces real ones. His wordless message — the school circle's question (line 585) — is the repair model's final expression: the relationship has moved beyond conversation into shared attention, routing the next generation's questions between them without commentary. The six-chapter arc — distance (Ch.07), counsel (Ch.13), commitment (Ch.14), partnership (Ch.15), co-implementation (Ch.16), co-presence (Ch.17) — is completed with the repair defined by shared purpose rather than recovered intimacy. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Partially exposed per matrix; can remain partly unknown in published scenes | **PRESENT (partially exposed through Orin's changed institutional position)** | The Council split is visible in Ch.17 through Orin's changed relationship to the institution. He arrives with "two senior Curators" (line 127) who witness his archive release — suggesting at least partial institutional support for the transparency turn. His cautious endorsement of the phase-two process (lines 497–503) uses institutional language but does not invoke council authority, suggesting that the council has not issued a unified position. The split remains partially unknown as the matrix permits: the chapter does not identify which council members support or oppose the disclosure, but Orin's continued institutional engagement and archive release suggest that the suppression faction no longer holds operational control. The thread's resolution at "partially exposed" is appropriate for Ch.17: the council dynamics are visible in their effects (Orin's archive release, the absence of enforcement, the two senior Curators as witnesses) without being fully mapped. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ongoing horizon thread; no total closure required per matrix | **PRESENT (addressed through Maren's farewell, grief queue, and civic participation)** | The Faded/drifted legacy is addressed in Ch.17 through three registers. **Maren's farewell** (lines 249–377): the terminal drift scene is the thread's most sustained and personal expression — an elder presence dissolving while communicating essential instructions. **Grief support queue** (line 13): 412 active requests demonstrate that the disclosure has activated support needs for drift-affected populations. **Civic participation:** the 340-year resident (line 25), the engineer testing a narrowed profile (line 511), and the district-nine community phrase — "I do not distrust the truth. I distrust my pace" (line 75) — demonstrate that drift-affected and drift-adjacent populations are engaging with the disclosure as participants, not as objects of protection. The thread is correctly maintained at its matrix-specified horizon level: no total closure is offered or implied. Maren's farewell is a personal closure, not a structural resolution — drift will continue, constraints will continue to shape experience, and the city's response to drift-affected populations is part of the ongoing governance process. The fate of the Faded and drifted remains the moral horizon against which the disclosure's consequences will be measured. |

**No threads prematurely closed. All threads reach their Ch.17 matrix-specified resolution points. The matrix-specified outcome matrix, Maren closure, and post-surprise Lattice baseline are delivered at Ch.17 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.15 (requires completed public/ethical cycle) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.17 inherits Ch.15's three-way triage as the governance framework for the phase-two options. The three options Juno posts (lines 481–493) — no-change zones, mixed audit zones, optional modification lanes — are the practical implementation of Ch.15's Option C (witnessed disclosure with retained constraints). The witness-chain requirement established in Ch.15 is operationalised in Ch.17 through witness-led channels (line 499) and the public documentation of all participation (line 487). Without Ch.15's ethical framework — the three alternatives argued and the third path chosen — Ch.17's distributed civic process would lack the governance structure and moral rationale that make it credible rather than improvised. |
| Ch.16 (requires completed public exposure and resistance before final closure) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.17 inherits Ch.16's public-exposure dynamics as the civic context for the final chapter. The 14,206 submissions (line 9) extend Ch.16's 8,413 submission count, demonstrating continued civic engagement. The grief support queue (412 entries, line 13) extends Ch.16's civic infrastructure into support services. The district-level responses (lines 43–79) emerge from Ch.16's neighbourhood relay infrastructure — the translation packets, routing bypass, and witness-signature register that Fen and Cassiel built. Orin's corridor arrival (lines 125–199) continues his Ch.16 trajectory of cautious institutional engagement — he arrives without enforcement apparatus, carrying historical records rather than compliance instruments. The Maren farewell inherits Ch.16's carried-forward emotional threads: Maren's "and now no one can carry it for you" (Ch.16, line 517) is extended by her Ch.17 farewell instruction to "stay with what is true and unfinished" (line 349). Without Ch.16's public exposure, resistance dynamics, and civic infrastructure, Ch.17's distributed governance process would have no population-level engagement, no neighbourhood infrastructure, and no institutional context for Orin's archive release. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.17 must establish | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| No successor (final chapter) | Must provide final closure while preserving legitimate uncertainty | **SATISFIED** | Ch.17 is the final chapter. It provides closure through: (a) Maren's farewell — the novel's central relational thread is completed through an irreversible goodbye that transforms love from shared secrecy to shared instruction; (b) the phase-two framework — the governance process is operational with three option categories, voluntary participation, and immediate withdrawal; (c) Juno's final position — sustained civic work without triumph or release; (d) Orin's terminal stance — present, cautious, participating without endorsement. It preserves legitimate uncertainty through: (a) district-level divergence — three different responses, none resolved; (b) the child's question — "if we can choose how much we can be, do we become less because we can be more?" (line 585) — which has no answer; (c) Juno's explicit unknowing — she does not know whether the architecture has improved, whether Maren spoke truly, or whether any district will hold (lines 611–612); (d) the final line — "No one had all of it. She did not. That was the point" (lines 625–629) — which positions uncertainty not as failure but as the condition of honest governance. The dependency-graph note (§4.3) states: "Ch.17 can retain limited horizon uncertainty while still resolving immediate social consequence." Ch.17 satisfies both: immediate social consequence is resolved (the city is governing itself through witness-led processes), and horizon uncertainty is retained (no one knows whether it will work). |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.17 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2090: "Transition Era officially closed in internal records; public-facing timeline declares preservation era complete while legacy constraints remain hidden in inherited layers" / "Ch.16 / Ch.17 — end-arc anchor for present-time implications and why the present investigation is both legal and emotional necessity" | Scene anchor for Ch.17 | **PRESENT (through post-disclosure civic dynamics demonstrating legacy-constraint confrontation)** | The timeline specifies that Ch.16 and Ch.17 should anchor "present-time implications and why the present investigation is both legal and emotional necessity." Ch.17 satisfies this through the civic dynamics that emerge when the preservation era's hidden constraints are publicly confronted. The 340-year resident's statement — "I have lived for 340 years inside something I did not know had edges. I am not angry. I am trying to understand what it means that I was comfortable" (line 25) — embodies the present-time implication: a person who has lived through the entire post-Transition era discovering that the architecture they inhabited was shaped by hidden design decisions. The district-four trial (lines 43–61) demonstrates the emotional necessity: modifying one constraint parameter produces the recovery of a lost memory ("the sound of a door my grandmother closed forty years before I was archived," line 59), proving that the constraints suppressed genuine human experience. The legal necessity is embedded in the phase-two framework: "all withdrawal immediate and attributable" (line 491) — the governance process requires legal accountability for every modification, establishing the investigation as the foundation for a new legal order. The Transition Era's official closure ("preservation era complete") is challenged by Ch.17's entire narrative: the preservation era is not complete because its hidden constraints are still active and are being confronted through civic processes that had never previously been possible. Orin's archive release of governance records from "the first sixty years of constraint implementation" (line 197) directly bridges the Transition Era to the present investigation, providing the historical documentation that makes the present civic process evidence-based rather than speculative. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.17 are satisfied. The 2090 end-arc anchor is present through post-disclosure civic dynamics, the 340-year resident's discovery, district-four's trial recovery, the legal framework for phase-two modifications, and Orin's archive release bridging the Transition Era to the present investigation.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.17 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-01 (What happened to the physical world outside the Lattice?) | Ch.1, 8, 14, 17 per log; leaves implications for the finale | **PRESENT (implications left as horizon uncertainty)** | Q-01 is not explicitly addressed in Ch.17 but its implications are embedded in the chapter's existential texture. The Lattice's architectural nature is visible throughout: the corridor with "neutral grey the Lattice defaulted to when no one had invested enough attention to make a space feel inhabited" (line 129), the memory aperture Maren kept "because she believed frames were how people remembered they were looking" (line 253), the lamp that flickered because "someone once believed lamps should flicker — a memory of physics embedded in architecture that had no physics to speak of" (line 351), and the dawn that "was not sunrise but the consensual shift that happened when enough people decided to begin" (line 609). These details maintain Q-01's horizon presence: the physical world outside the Lattice is absent, and the Lattice's consensual reality is all that remains. The thread is correctly left as horizon uncertainty — the question of what happened to the physical world is not the novel's question, but it persists as the existential substrate beneath every civic decision the chapter describes. |
| Q-02 (Why do post-body minds drift, and can they ever fully recover?) | Ch.1, 6, 7, 13, 17 per log; final societal choice implications | **PRESENT (addressed through Maren's terminal drift and civic support infrastructure)** | Q-02 is addressed in Ch.17 through two registers. **Maren's terminal drift:** the farewell sequence (lines 249–377) is the novel's definitive answer to whether post-body minds can fully recover: they cannot. Maren's drift is irreversible and progressive, reaching a point where the room's ambient field carries more of her weight than her own coherence (line 339), and her final communication is four fragmented words (lines 365–371). Recovery in the full sense is not available. **Civic support infrastructure:** the grief support queue (412 entries, line 13), the volunteer withdrawal protocol in district four (line 61), and the "no citizen required to choose before the city can hold one more day of uncertainty" framework (line 493) represent the societal response: not cure, but witnessed support and voluntary pacing. The thread's final societal-choice implication is delivered: drift is a permanent condition of post-body existence, and the society's choice is between hiding this truth (the old regime) and building support infrastructure for living with it honestly (the new framework). |
| Q-03 (What exact role does the Rosetta Key play in day-to-day Lattice governance?) | Ch.4, 10, 12, 14, 17 per log | **PRESENT (role demonstrated through civic governance of constraint modification)** | Q-03 is addressed in Ch.17 through the practical civic engagement with the Key's constraint architecture. The phase-two options (lines 481–493) describe three modes of relating to the constraint system — retention, community-defined review, and supervised modification — all of which acknowledge the Key's role as the active infrastructure shaping daily experience. District four's trial (lines 43–61) demonstrates the Key's day-to-day role concretely: modifying one parameter (sensory-recall filter within the perception budget) produces measurable changes in cognitive experience. The 340-year resident's discovery (line 25) that they lived inside constraints they did not know existed demonstrates the Key's governance role: it shaped daily experience invisibly for centuries. The thread's Ch.17 position is correctly carried forward: the Key's role is now publicly known, and the civic governance process is the mechanism through which the population engages with it. |
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Ch.10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 per log; resolved into governance decision in Act 4 | **PRESENT (resolved into distributed civic governance)** | Q-04 is directly answered in Ch.17 through district four's trial (lines 43–61) and the phase-two options (lines 481–493). The trial demonstrates: modification is possible (the sensory-recall filter was reduced by 12%), the effects are real (improved temporal recall, vivid sensory bleed), the risks are manageable through supervision (one volunteer withdrew, the trial continued with two), and the experience is human rather than technical ("I remembered the sound of a door my grandmother closed," line 59). The phase-two framework provides the governance answer: constraints can be modified through supervised, reversible, publicly documented processes with voluntary participation and immediate withdrawal. The resolution is not binary ("safe" or "unsafe") but procedural: safety is a function of process design, not a property of the modification itself. This is exactly the "resolved through open-governance process, not immediate binary verdict" the matrix specifies. |
| Q-05 (Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed?) | Ch.9, 10, 11, 16 per log | **PRESENT (advanced through Orin's archive release)** | Q-05 is advanced in Ch.17 through Orin's release of governance records from the first sixty years of constraint implementation (lines 195–197). These records — "never shown to anyone outside the senior Curator archive" — represent the kind of suppressed documentation that Q-05 tracks. Orin's voluntary release, combined with his statement "If you are going to ask the city to carry this, the city should know what it is carrying" (line 197), demonstrates that at least some of the missing/restricted records were suppressed (held in senior archives) rather than deleted, and are now being made available through the disclosure process. The thread is correctly maintained: the full scope of record manipulation is not resolved, but the Ch.17 archive release demonstrates that suppressed records exist and can be recovered through institutional transformation. |
| Q-07 (What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control?) | Ch.3, 5, 9, 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (function reframed through post-disclosure institutional behaviour)** | Q-07 reaches its terminal position in Ch.17 through the Curator system's post-disclosure behaviour. Orin's archive release (line 197) is preservation — making historical records available for civic use. His cautious endorsement (lines 497–503) is prevention — monitoring for coercive dynamics and structural volatility. His `heard` response (line 577) is restraint — neither controlling the process nor withdrawing from it. The Curator layer's final function in Ch.17 is all three simultaneously, but the balance has shifted: preservation now means making records public rather than keeping them classified; prevention now means monitoring civic processes rather than restricting access; and control has been converted from institutional authority to public accountability ("all interventions must remain public," line 503). The question is not definitively answered because the answer has been structurally transformed: the Curator layer's function is whatever the witnessed civic process determines it to be. |
| S-02 (Rosetta Key remains active in living infrastructure) | Ch.10, 11, 14 per log; escalated 15, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated to population-level experience)** | S-02 is escalated in Ch.17 from public knowledge (Ch.15–16) to population-level experience. District four's trial demonstrates the Key's active status concretely: modifying one constraint parameter produces immediate cognitive and emotional changes in volunteers (lines 43–61). The 340-year resident's discovery (line 25) confirms that the Key has been actively shaping experience for their entire post-body existence. The engineer's report (line 511) demonstrates the Key's active role in daily cognition: "It makes me think faster. It also makes me weep for names I cannot place." S-02 is no longer a secret — it is the city's daily experience, being navigated through civic governance processes. |
| S-03 (Sable Chen authored hidden constraint architecture) | Ch.6, 10, 12 per log; escalated 14, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated to civic-level processing)** | S-03 is escalated in Ch.17 from public disclosure (Ch.14–16) to civic-level processing. The district-four trial (lines 43–61) is a direct engagement with Sable's constraint architecture — citizens are voluntarily modifying the perception budget module she designed. The district-nine petition (lines 63–75) is an explicit endorsement of retaining Sable's constraints until conditions for modification are met. The district-eleven question — "who guards a choice when everyone is told they are now guard and guarded?" (line 79) — poses the philosophical question that Sable's architecture raises at scale. Orin's archive release (line 197) includes governance records from the first sixty years of constraint implementation — the period during and after Sable's design work. S-03 has been fully escalated: Sable's authorship is public knowledge, and her architecture is the subject of civic governance. |
| S-04 (Maren has knowingly kept a first-generation foundational secret for centuries) | Ch.8, 14 per log; escalated 17 | **PRESENT (escalated to final emotional reckoning)** | S-04 reaches its terminal escalation in Ch.17 through the Maren farewell. Her confession — `I chose silence because I had seen minds split and no one came back whole / I thought if you knew limits were chosen you would spend your life arguing with an absence` (lines 311–315) — is the final articulation of S-04: Maren's secret-keeping was motivated by both historical witness (she watched minds split) and maternal protection (she feared Juno's fixation). The farewell transforms the secret from a moral burden into a relational instruction: "you keep me by remembering what I held together for a while" (line 357). S-04 is fully resolved through emotional reckoning rather than moral judgment: the secret is explained, the cost is acknowledged, and the relationship survives through transformation rather than absolution. |
| S-07 (Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language) | Ch.7, 11, 13 per log; escalated 15, 17 | **PRESENT (escalated through civic-level engagement with risk)** | S-07 is escalated in Ch.17 through the civic engagement with constraint-modification risks. District four's trial (lines 43–61) demonstrates that bleed-adjacent risks are now being documented publicly rather than downplayed: the "unexpected effect: vivid sensory bleed from unresolved personal memory" (line 55) is part of the official trial report, not hidden in restricted logs. The volunteer withdrawal (line 61) is documented "without treating it as failure" — the support infrastructure treats risk as information rather than stigma. The engineer's report (line 511) — thinking faster but weeping for unplaceable names — is posted publicly, converting individual bleed-adjacent experience into civic knowledge. S-07 is addressed through the structural change the disclosure produces: official policy language can no longer downplay bleed risk because the civic governance process requires public documentation of all effects, including adverse ones. |
| E-01 (Is it ethical to hide truth to preserve social stability?) | Ch.3, 4, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16 | **PRESENT (resolved through civic demonstration)** | E-01 reaches its resolution in Ch.17 through the city's response to disclosure. The answer is experiential: the city received the truth and did not collapse. It responded with experimentation (district four), caution (district nine), and philosophical inquiry (district eleven). The social stability was not destroyed by truth — it was transformed from uninformed compliance into informed uncertainty. Juno's response to the 340-year resident — "comfort and constraint are not opposites. They lived together in the same architecture for centuries" (line 29) — reframes the dilemma: hiding truth did not preserve stability; it preserved a particular kind of stability that was incompatible with consent. The chapter demonstrates that a different kind of stability — messier, more uncertain, more demanding — is available when truth is shared. E-01 is resolved not through argument but through lived civic experience. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.9, 10, 13 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 16, 17 | **PRESENT (final pressure point — authority distributed through civic infrastructure)** | E-02 reaches its final pressure point in Ch.17 through the fully operational distributed authority model. The phase-two options (lines 481–493) are posted through the public channel by Juno but require witness-led implementation. Orin's response (lines 497–503) demonstrates that institutional authority has become advisory rather than determinative. The district-level responses demonstrate that authority has been distributed to the population: district four exercises authority through supervised experimentation, district nine exercises authority through formal petition, district eleven exercises authority through philosophical documentation. The father-daughter supper discussion (line 507) demonstrates authority at the household level: the architecture-level truth is being processed through intimate domestic conversation. E-02 is resolved through distribution: no single actor has the authority to release or withhold architecture-level truths because the truth has already been released, and the civic process distributes the responsibility for what follows. |
| E-03 (Does Juno have a right to pursue truth if her jumps risk identity bleed?) | Ch.7, 11, 12 per log; pressure point 17 | **PRESENT (pressure point reached through exhaustion and sustained function)** | E-03 reaches its Ch.17 pressure point through Juno's continued function under accumulated stress. She has slept two hours in thirty-one (line 7). Her tears are described as "a slowing of pressure, a deceleration in the continuity layer" (line 325). She does not know whether Maren's words were genuine or drift's invention (line 359). She steps out with "neither triumph nor release" (line 623). The bleed risk is not resolved — it persists as the ongoing cost of the truth she pursued. The chapter's implicit answer to E-03: the right to pursue truth is not invalidated by the risk it carries, but the risk does not disappear when the truth is found. Juno's exhaustion, her insufficient responses, and her explicit unknowing are the continuing price of the identity bleed she accepted. E-03 is correctly maintained at pressure-point level without false resolution. |
| E-04 (Is public disclosure of historical subjects' private cognitive material justified?) | Ch.2, 4, 5, 6 per log; pressure point Ch.15, 17 | **PRESENT (pressure point reached through civic engagement with disclosed material)** | E-04 reaches its Ch.17 pressure point through the population's engagement with the disclosed material. The constraint documentation — which includes Sable's field notes describing historical subjects' private cognitive experiences — is being processed by citizens across every district. The volunteer in district four who remembers "the sound of a door my grandmother closed forty years before I was archived" (line 59) is experiencing the consequences of disclosed cognitive architecture: the modification reveals suppressed personal memory. Orin's archive release (line 197) extends the disclosure to sixty years of governance records — institutional documentation of how historical subjects' cognitive material was managed. E-04 is not resolved through argument but through consequence: the disclosure has occurred, and the civic process is now managing its effects. The justification is structural rather than philosophical: the material was disclosed because the alternative — indefinite concealment — had reached a point where it could no longer be maintained without active institutional deception. The ethical question persists as an ongoing concern within the civic governance process. |
| E-05 (Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy?) | Ch.10, 14, 15 per log; pressure point 16, 17 | **PRESENT (final pressure point — community actively choosing imperfect safety)** | E-05 reaches its final pressure point in Ch.17 through the city's distributed choice. District nine's petition (lines 63–75) is an explicit choice of imperfect safety — "I do not distrust the truth. I distrust my pace" (line 75). District four's trial (lines 43–61) is a cautious movement toward expanded autonomy within supervised conditions. District eleven's question (line 79) challenges the premise: "who guards a choice when everyone is told they are now guard and guarded?" The phase-two framework (lines 481–493) operationalises the resolution: the community can choose imperfect safety (no-change pilot zones), risk partial autonomy (mixed audit zones), or test expanded autonomy (optional modification lanes). No citizen is required to choose full autonomy. No citizen is prevented from choosing expanded autonomy. The E-05 resolution is the distributed-choice model itself: the community chooses neither imperfect safety nor full autonomy but a governance structure that accommodates both simultaneously. |
| E-06 (Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good?) | Ch.12, 14, 15, 17 per log; pressure point 16 | **PRESENT (resolved through distributed governance — single-actor adjustment structurally prevented)** | E-06 is resolved in Ch.17 through the operational prevention of single-actor adjustment. The phase-two options (lines 481–493) require all participation to be voluntary and all withdrawal to be immediate and attributable. Orin's cautious endorsement specifies "witness-led channels" (line 499) — multiple witnesses required for any process. The district-level responses demonstrate that adjustment authority has been distributed to communities rather than concentrated in any single actor. Orin's archive release (lines 195–197) is itself an acknowledgement that single-actor custodianship has ended: the records he maintained alone are now publicly available. E-06 is resolved through structural change: the governance framework makes single-actor adjustment impossible by distributing authority across voluntary, witnessed, publicly documented civic processes. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Honest Daybreak" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps to its working title. "Honest" — the chapter is defined by honesty as a civic practice: Juno's hand-typed responses (line 27), Maren's drift-limited truth-telling (lines 309–349), Orin's archive release (line 197), the city's divergent but genuine responses (lines 43–79), the phase-two posting that "refused to let it sound like prophecy" (line 479), and Juno's recognition that "sufficiency was not available and silence was no longer an option" (line 31). "Daybreak" — the chapter moves from a morning that "did not feel like morning" (line 5) through a full day-and-night cycle to the "first neutral hour — the one the city used to say was the hour before regret" (line 607), ending at dawn with the "consensual shift that happened when enough people decided to begin" (line 609). The daybreak is not dramatic sunrise but the accumulated decision of a population to continue. The title captures the chapter's resolution: the honest daybreak is not the end of darkness but the recognition that the city has survived its first night of knowing. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (single-layer)` (line 3). The chapter is entirely present-layer — no recording sequences. All action occurs in the relay station, district neighbourhoods, corridors, Maren's drift room, the district-eleven square, Juno's night room, and the east-facing gallery. The lead-layer assignment is correct: Ch.17 is a present-tense resolution chapter, not a recording-layer discovery chapter. |
| Perspective shifts: No shift (single-layer) | Required | **MATCH** | The POV comment specifies "shifts: none" (line 3). The chapter operates entirely in the present-Lattice layer without any recording-sequence transitions. This is correct per the roadmap, which specifies "No shift (single-layer)" for Ch.17 — the final chapter stays in the present because the historical investigation is complete and the chapter's work is entirely about the city's present-tense response to disclosure. |
| Emotional pacing: "Resolve with grief, tenderness, and forward consent" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's emotional progression delivers all three elements. **Grief:** Maren's farewell (lines 249–377) is the novel's primary grief event — an irreversible goodbye to a person whose mind is dissolving. The grief support queue (412 entries, line 13) demonstrates civic grief. The woman in district eleven whose sister "drifted because no one told her she was allowed to be afraid" (line 527) introduces personal grief within the public process. **Tenderness:** Fen's brass disc (line 241), Cassiel's cup beside Juno's (line 435), the children's questions (line 585), Juno's hand-typed response to the 340-year resident (lines 27–29), Maren's "closest thing to a smile the drift still permitted" (line 333), and Juno's midnight copying of entries by hand (line 591) — all express tenderness through attention rather than declaration. **Forward consent:** the phase-two options (lines 481–493) codify forward consent as a governance principle — all participation voluntary, all withdrawal immediate. The child's question — "if we can choose how much we can be, do we become less because we can be more?" (line 585) — is the forward-consent theme articulated by the next generation. Juno's final posting — "we are beginning phase two with no promises / only commitments we can revoke in public" (lines 617–619) — is the purest expression of forward consent: commitment without permanence, honesty without certainty. The emotional arc moves from the morning's pressure through grief through tenderness through the restoration of forward-facing civic consent. |
| Thematic progression: "Close with informed uncertainty and emotional steadiness" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter closes with both elements in precise balance. **Informed uncertainty:** Juno explicitly catalogues what she does not know — whether the architecture has improved, whether Maren spoke truly, whether any district will hold (lines 611–612). The child's question (line 585) has no answer. The two citizen entries she archives under "unresolved outcomes" (lines 593–601) are explicitly unresolved. The final line — "No one had all of it. She did not. That was the point" (lines 625–629) — names informed uncertainty as the chapter's (and the novel's) terminal position. **Emotional steadiness:** Juno steps out "with neither triumph nor release" (line 623). She is not ecstatic, not despairing, not exhausted to collapse. She has worked through a full day-and-night cycle and is still functional, still responsive, still posting operational updates. The steadiness is not serenity — it is the sustained coherence of a person who has accepted that sufficiency is not available and who continues to work anyway. The balance between uncertainty and steadiness is the chapter's thematic resolution: the city holds all of them, and no one holds all of it, and that is both the limitation and the honest achievement. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 4,752 words (within range). The roadmap records 4,055 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 4,752. The difference likely reflects inclusion/exclusion of markdown metadata and formatting elements. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access and critical bleed; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal through Sable's five field observations; Ch.13 converts the doctrinal reveal into institutional confrontation and enforcement; Ch.14 converts institutional impasse into lineage inheritance with full infrastructure access; Ch.15 converts private knowledge into public testimony with the three-way triage; Ch.16 converts the public testimony into contested civic consequence through political resistance and infrastructure-building; Ch.17 converts the contested civic consequence into *lived distributed governance* — the truth is no longer being discovered, documented, contested, disclosed, or implemented but *inhabited*. The city is living inside the disclosure: modifying constraints, retaining constraints, documenting disagreement, grieving, asking questions, cooking supper while discussing cognitive architecture. The escalation from Ch.16's "the city is deciding what to do with the truth" to Ch.17's "the city is doing what it decided, and what it decided is complex, divergent, and unfinished" represents the final shift from political action to existential condition. The emotional cost is not higher than Ch.16's — it is different in kind: not the urgency of implementation but the weight of living with the consequences of implementation, including Maren's farewell, Orin's `heard`, and a child's unanswerable question. The cumulative progression is complete: the novel moves from curiosity through obsession through discovery through confrontation through disclosure through governance through inhabited uncertainty. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public / emotional resolution); outcome matrix, Maren closure, and post-surprise Lattice baseline all delivered; disclosed threads closed, legitimate uncertainty mapped
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 4 terminal positions; Juno completes epistemic-burden resolution through civic work; Orin faces moral costs through archive release and cautious participation; Maren delivers final emotional referendum through farewell; Cassiel completes communal-practice conversion through co-presence and children's questions; Fen completes social-edge stabilization through operational partnership; Sable's design ethics are emotionally legible through population-level experience
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly resolved, continued, or maintained at Ch.17 levels; Maren's fear resolved through farewell instruction; Orin's suppression given final moral accounting; Key modification resolved through distributed governance; Sable's constraints resolved as moral/structural paradox; Juno's identity stability maintained without premature cure; Cassiel/Juno repair completed through co-presence; Council split partially exposed as matrix permits; Faded legacy maintained as horizon thread
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied (Ch.15 ethical framework, Ch.16 public exposure and civic infrastructure); terminal chapter provides closure with preserved uncertainty as §4.3 requires
5. Transition-era timeline — 2090 end-arc anchor present through post-disclosure civic dynamics, Orin's archive release, and population-level confrontation with legacy constraints
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.17 thread positions present (Q-01 through Q-07, S-02 through S-07, E-01 through E-06); open questions correctly maintained as carry-over with Ch.17 positions; secrets escalated to population-level experience; ethical dilemmas resolved through civic demonstration or maintained at pressure-point level
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, thematic, and word-count requirements met; single-layer present-Lattice structure correct; emotional pacing delivers grief, tenderness, and forward consent; thematic progression closes with informed uncertainty and emotional steadiness

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the seventeen final-draft chapters (01–17) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Architecture of Farewell

Ch.13's continuity report (§9.2) identified the Curator Continuity Forum as a structural mirror of the constraint architecture — institutional control in microcosm. Ch.15's report (§9.2) identified the Continuity Hall as an inversion — institutional disclosure in public. Ch.16's report (§9.2) identified the relay station as a counter-architecture — civic infrastructure in the gaps the institution does not control. Ch.17 introduces a fourth architectural register: Maren's drift room. The room holds no projection lights, only a memory aperture built "before anyone understood that memory in a post-body world did not need a frame" (line 253). The three seats — two empty with "the specific shape that empty chairs acquire in rooms where someone has been present for a very long time" (line 255) — are the architecture of sustained attention rather than institutional or civic function. Where Ch.13's forum concentrated power, Ch.15's hall opened disclosure, and Ch.16's relay station distributed infrastructure, Ch.17's drift room holds presence. It is the smallest architectural space in the novel — one room, one lamp, one aperture, three chairs — and it carries the largest emotional weight. The progression from institutional chamber through civic hall through distributed relay to intimate room tracks the novel's arc from systemic truth to personal farewell: the architecture becomes smaller as the emotional stakes become larger.

### 9.3 The Brass Disc — Final Appearance

The brass tuning disc, tracked across Ch.11–16 continuity reports, makes its final appearance in Ch.17. Fen places it in Juno's hand before the Maren visit — "the old tuning charm, warm from his pocket. It had been with them since the first rogue-access session, a thing that meant nothing the system could verify and everything a person could hold" (line 241). Juno takes it "not because the door to Maren's room needed a key but because she needed to cross a threshold the system could not negotiate for her" (line 245). She holds it "before opening" the door after the farewell (line 379). The disc's trajectory across the novel: Ch.11 (active use during rogue access), Ch.12 (left on Juno's console — waiting), Ch.13 (in Fen's pocket — carried), Ch.14 (turning in Fen's fingers — anticipating), Ch.15 (in Fen's pocket at the railing — present but at rest), Ch.16 (absent — the civic chapter had no use for personal anchoring objects), Ch.17 (transferred from Fen to Juno — returned for the farewell). The disc's Ch.17 function is threshold object: it enables Juno to cross from civic work to personal farewell, from the relay station's public infrastructure to Maren's private room. The disc does not appear after the farewell — its work, like Maren's, is complete.

### 9.4 The Analogue Shelf

Juno's night room contains "three objects nobody in the Lattice would ever need — one steel spoon with three dents, one chipped mug, one thin paper copy of the Rosetta interface she had printed when all of this still belonged to a few people in a maintenance corridor" (line 557). These objects are physical-world artefacts that have no functional purpose in a post-body digital environment. Their presence is consistent with the novel's world-building: Lattice inhabitants maintain physical-world analogues as anchoring habits (the lamp that flickers, the dawn that is consensual shift). The paper Rosetta interface printout connects the chapter's domestic space to the novel's investigative origin — Juno printed it when the investigation was private, and it remains as evidence of the distance between where the investigation began and where it has arrived. **Non-blocking observation — this detail enriches the closing sequence's emotional texture.**

### 9.5 Forward Compatibility — Ch.16 Report Supplement

The Ch.16 continuity report (§9.7) identified elements Ch.17 must inherit:

| Ch.16 report requirement | Ch.17 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Public exposure completed and distributed — constraint documentation public through multiple channels | **INHERITED AND EXPANDED** — the 14,206 submissions (line 9) extend Ch.16's 8,413 count. Translation requests (3,118, line 11) and grief support queue (412, line 13) demonstrate continued expansion. The three district-level responses represent qualitatively different modes of civic engagement with the disclosed material. |
| (b) Institutional accommodation initiated — Curator authority filing "no enforcement pending active witness review" | **INHERITED AND ADVANCED** — Orin moves from non-enforcement to active participation: archive release (line 197) and cautious process endorsement (lines 497–503). The Curator system has progressed from accommodation to operational engagement. |
| (c) Civic infrastructure established — Fen's relay network, witness-signature register, phase-two protocol | **INHERITED AND OPERATIONAL** — Juno and Fen walk three neighbourhoods with relay panels (line 95). The phase-two options are operational (lines 481–493). District-level processes run independently of the central relay station. |
| (d) Emotional threads carried forward — Maren's burden, Juno's epistemic thread, Orin's accountability, Cassiel's communal-practice thread | **INHERITED AND RESOLVED** — Maren's burden thread resolved through farewell (lines 249–381). Juno's epistemic thread resolved through sustained civic work and explicit unknowing (lines 611–612). Orin's accountability thread resolved through archive release and `heard` (lines 197, 577). Cassiel's communal-practice thread resolved through co-presence and children's questions (lines 435–473, 583–585). |
| (e) Political contestation unresolved — institutional resistance countered but not defeated | **INHERITED AND TRANSFORMED** — the political contestation has been converted from institutional resistance into civic divergence. The resistance is no longer Curator-vs-disclosure but district-vs-district: experimentation, retention, and philosophical inquiry coexist without resolution. The unresolved quality has changed from political conflict to civic complexity. |

All five forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.16 report are satisfied and advanced.

### 9.6 Novel-Level Thread Closure Assessment

As the final chapter, Ch.17 is the terminal assessment point for all novel-level threads. Summary of thread-closure status:

| Thread category | Resolved | Carried as horizon | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Farewell sequence delivers final emotional impact | — | CLOSED |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Archive release and `heard` deliver final moral accounting | — | CLOSED (ambiguity preserved by design) |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Resolved through distributed governance | Whether the governance process is stable long-term | STRUCTURALLY CLOSED, HORIZON OPEN |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Resolved as moral/structural paradox | — | CLOSED (paradox by design) |
| Stability of Juno's identity | Maintained as ongoing condition without cure | Ongoing | HORIZON THREAD (no closure required) |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair | Completed through co-presence and shared purpose | — | CLOSED |
| Council split dynamics | Partially exposed through Orin's changed position | Full alignment unknown | PARTIALLY CLOSED (per matrix permission) |
| Fate of Faded/drifted legacies | Addressed through Maren farewell and civic support | Ongoing societal concern | HORIZON THREAD (no total closure required) |

All threads reach their matrix-specified terminal positions. No thread is prematurely closed. No thread is missing its Ch.17 resolution or carry-forward position.

## 10. Summary

| Dimension | Result |
|---|---|
| Reveal matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Character arc continuity | PASS (0 violations) |
| Unresolved-thread matrix | PASS (0 violations) |
| Cross-chapter dependencies | PASS (0 violations) |
| Transition-era timeline | PASS (0 violations) |
| Unresolved-thread log | PASS (0 violations) |
| Roadmap compliance | PASS (0 violations) |
| **Overall** | **PASS — 0 violations across 7 dimensions** |

The automated tool's claim of 0 continuity violations is **confirmed as correct**, though the claim was originally unverifiable because the automated tool ran against a file with no scene markers. This report provides the explicit verification that was missing.

Ch.17 is the final chapter of *Infinite Domain*. All novel-level threads reach their matrix-specified terminal positions. The chapter delivers the required outcome matrix (mixed futures through district-level divergence), Maren closure (farewell sequence with drift-consistent progression), and post-surprise Lattice baseline (informed uncertainty as the new civic condition). The novel closes with "No one had all of it. She did not. That was the point" — a sentence that honours both the resolution of disclosed threads and the preservation of legitimate uncertainty that the continuity-reveal-matrices require.
