## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-12.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-12.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 12 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Sable's design architecture is directly experienced: constraints are active, intentional, and stabilizing | **PRESENT** | Ch.12's entire narrative structure is built around Juno reading five of Sable's degraded field observation recordings and directly experiencing the constraint architecture through Sable's own testimony. The chapter delivers the three named constraint layers with operational detail across five fragments: (1) **Perception budget** — filters sensory input and memory recall, operates below conscious threshold. Fragment 1 (2055-06-14, lines 33–67): Sable observes first-generation post-body cohort at building 7 and documents that the perception budget "applies to recall as well as intake. Every memory that returns through the continuity layer is filtered through the same constraint stack that governs present experience" (line 65). Subject 14 asks whether he is *allowed* to access his wife's voice without system smoothing; Sable reveals the system smooths all memories — "He does not hear her as she was. He hears her as the architecture decides he can bear" (line 65). (2) **Cognition gate** — limits processing speed and certainty formation, prevents convergent optimisation. Fragment 2 (2057-03-22, lines 75–111): a woman in seven-year continuity reports she no longer argues with herself: "Now I have one opinion. It arrives quickly. It feels correct" (line 95). Sable's observation note: "Cognition gate reduces internal contradiction below the threshold of felt experience. Subject does not miss the contradiction because the gate operates before awareness. She is not choosing clarity. She is being given it" (line 107). (3) **Self-modification boundary** — regulates identity changes, requires validation windows. Fragment 3 (2058-11-09, lines 137–165): a man requests to change his voice because "it did not sound like him anymore" (line 147). The self-modification boundary flags the request, and the validation returns negative — not because the change was dangerous, but because "the system could not distinguish between a person who wanted to sound like himself and a person who was drifting toward someone else's voice" (line 155). Sable's clipboard note: "The boundary cannot distinguish between healing and drift. This is not a flaw. It is the cost of the design" (line 163). (4) **Drift suppression protocol** — absorbs identity variance into infrastructure. Fragment 4 (2059-08-03, lines 209–243): Sable documents the protocol at subsurface level for Cohort 12 (241 post-body minds). The protocol "redistributes" variance: "The variance that would have appeared as identity flux — changed preferences, shifted memories, altered emotional baselines — is absorbed into the maintenance layer and expressed as infrastructure load" (line 225). Sable contextualises the rationale: "We saw a woman describe a room in five dimensions and then forget she had a name. We saw a man rewrite his own memory of his daughter because the optimisation loop told him the rewrite was more efficient" (line 239). The constraints were built not from wisdom but from earned fear (line 243). (5) **Sable's mercy/governance/control formulation** — Fragment 5 (2060-01-17, lines 263–293): Sable addresses the camera directly in a personal note "not for institutional record." She names each layer as a form of mercy — perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary — and delivers the chapter's doctrinal thesis: "mercy without consent is governance. And governance without disclosure is control. And control without accountability is —" (line 279). The sentence goes unfinished. Juno's present-layer synthesis (lines 177–183, 307–317) consolidates all three layers plus drift suppression into a constraint architecture summary: "All layers active. All layers maintained by Rosetta Key process. All layers operating on every mind in the Lattice without disclosure or consent" (line 317). |
| Reveal status: "Public / doctrinal reveal" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter delivers the **doctrinal** reveal — the full operational description and ethical articulation of the constraint architecture — through five direct recordings from its designer. The reveal moves beyond Ch.10's process-handle confirmation ("the Key is running") and Ch.11's operational policy evidence (`policy_9d`, KEY-ANCHOR metadata) to deliver the constraints as *experienced phenomena*: Juno sees what the perception budget does to a man's memories (Fragment 1), what the cognition gate does to a woman's internal life (Fragment 2), what the self-modification boundary does to a person's voice (Fragment 3), and what drift suppression does to an entire cohort's capacity for variance (Fragment 4). Sable's personal note (Fragment 5) provides the doctrinal articulation: the constraints are mercy, governance, and control simultaneously, and the distinction depends on consent and accountability — neither of which exist. The reveal is "public" in the narrative sense: Juno now possesses the complete architectural description and can explain it to others. It is "doctrinal" because the chapter delivers not merely facts but the moral-structural paradox the constraints represent — the "freedom vs stability" core mechanics are now "knowable and can be debated publicly" as the matrix requires. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.12 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the doctrinal-reveal chapter described in the matrix, delivering the constraint architecture as directly experienced phenomenon through Sable's field observations, with the moral-structural paradox fully articulated.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She chooses rogue jump behavior and accepts overt risk; emotional and cognitive costs are explicit | **PRESENT (continued from Ch.11)** | Ch.12 opens in the immediate aftermath of Ch.11's rogue access. Juno's bleed markers read "immediate" (line 11) — downgraded from Ch.11's critical but still dangerous: "you are still yourself, but the margin is thin, and the thinness is not improving" (line 11). Anchor-drift is at "moderate-high" with mild motor contamination (lines 125–128). The system recommends she "cease recording access for minimum 6 hours" (line 129); she does not cease (line 131). She continues reading degraded fragments despite active bleed status, explicitly extending the rogue-access risk posture established in Ch.11. Her hands shake after Fragment 4 — "Not the fine-motor tremor of bleed contamination. A different kind — the involuntary response of a body, real or simulated, that has received information it cannot hold without physical expression" (lines 249–251). The costs are explicit and embodied: shaking hands (lines 249, 371), the "coherence margin" she spent on the five fragments (line 301), and the understanding that the system carrying her awareness is the same system she is now documenting (line 337). |
| Obsession at correct Act 3 intensity | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's Act 3 obsession has evolved from Ch.11's operational commitment (executing the rogue jump) to Ch.12's epistemic commitment (processing what the rogue jump produced). She reads all five fragments despite immediate bleed status and a system recommendation to cease. She does not eat, does not rest, does not pause between fragments except to write tracker notes. Her motivation is no longer investigative compulsion but a different register: "Not gathering. Not extracting. Reading. The kind of reading that required a person to hold what they found without deciding what it meant, because the meaning was still arriving" (line 27). The obsession is correctly distinguished from Ch.11's operational urgency — Juno is not breaking protocols but processing evidence, and the processing itself carries bleed cost because the evidence is delivered through the same degraded channels she risked her identity to access. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early (Act 2 concern) | **NO VIOLATION** | Ch.12's obsession is Act 3 in register — it builds directly on Ch.11's rogue jump and operates at the level of doctrinal understanding rather than investigative discovery. The distinction from Act 2 is preserved: in Act 2, Juno was gathering evidence (journals, process handles, metadata); in Act 3, she is processing the evidence's moral and architectural implications. The escalation is sequential and earned. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit gatekeeper and enforcer; moves from persuasion to operational containment | **PRESENT (escalated from Ch.11)** | Orin's enforcement escalation takes two institutional forms in Ch.12. First, a formal message (lines 187–198): "Your deep-access session has been logged and classified as a governance referral. All material extracted during the session is subject to review hold. You are directed to suspend further archive interaction until the review is complete. This is not a request." The language moves beyond Ch.11's recovery notice ("please hold current archive actions until review") to explicit directive: "This is not a request" (line 197). Second, the governance review notice (lines 325–333): `status: active`, `scope: unauthorized recording access, material extraction, rogue deep-channel engagement`, `assigned reviewer: orin thalassa`, with all extracted material subject to hold and access to sealed containers suspended "effective immediately" (line 333). The review is assigned to Orin himself — the person whose authority Juno defied is now the assigned reviewer of her defiance. The containers are locked, the mirrors frozen (line 335). Orin has moved from persuasion (Ch.03–09), through policy containment (Ch.09), through institutional recovery notice (Ch.11), to operational enforcement with material seizure and access suspension (Ch.12). |
| No overexposure of intentions before evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin does not appear directly in Ch.12. His presence is mediated through two institutional communications — the formal message and the governance review notice — both written in procedural language. Juno's interpretation provides the character insight: "the sound of a man who had spent centuries protecting a process he believed in, discovering that someone had seen behind it and had not looked away" (line 199). This interpretation builds on Ch.11's evidence (Juno now possesses the full constraint-architecture description) but preserves Orin's moral ambiguity: Juno describes him as "someone who believed in" the process, not as someone who maliciously suppressed it. Whether his belief justified the suppression remains the open question for Ch.13–14. |

### 2.3 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fully allied with Juno's high-risk phase, while retaining practical fears and questions | **PRESENT** | Fen appears in two scenes. At the chapter's opening, he is described as having gone to sleep "not willingly" two hours ago (line 9), having "fought the decision the way a person fights a current they know is winning" (line 9). He left the brass tuning disc on Juno's console — the anchoring object established in Ch.11 — as a material proxy for his presence during the fragments she reads alone. At the chapter's close (lines 341–371), Fen is waiting in the corridor, having either not slept or having "slept the way she had — pretending" (line 341). His face holds "the specific expression of a person who has been counting the minutes since they stopped being able to help and has not stopped counting" (line 341). His practical questioning persists: "And Orin?" (line 355) — a two-word question that requests situation assessment rather than emotional processing. Fen's alliance is fully operational: he receives Juno's summary of the constraint architecture (lines 353–361), takes back the brass disc (line 351), and walks with her through the verification gates into the intake hall (lines 363–371). His practical fears are retained through his restlessness and counting, but his commitment is unqualified. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's alliance in Ch.12 is the continuation of his Ch.11 commitment (active accomplice during rogue access). His presence is muted — he is mostly absent during the fragment readings and returns for the closing exchange — which is structurally appropriate for a chapter centred on Juno's private processing of Sable's recordings. His concern is expressed through waiting and counting rather than confrontation, consistent with his established pattern of practical solidarity. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Becomes explicit ethical counterweight to suppression logic | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.12** | Cassiel does not appear in Ch.12. The chapter's action is entirely focused on Juno's private reading of Sable's field observations and her immediate institutional consequences. Cassiel's ethical-counterweight arc (per the matrix) requires the discovery to be processed relationally and politically — a mode that belongs to Ch.13 when the enforcement escalation forces wider engagement. Cassiel's absence is structurally appropriate: Ch.12 is a doctrinal-reveal chapter operating between Juno and Sable's recordings, not a relational or political chapter. |

### 2.5 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full confirmation of past knowledge and responsibility appears in a late Act 3 testimony context (Ch.14 per matrix) | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.12 (inherited)** | Maren does not appear directly in Ch.12. However, her presence is inherited through one significant structural echo. In Fragment 3 (lines 137–165), the man who requested a voice change looks toward the back wall with "an expression Juno had seen once before, in Maren's eyes on a clear day: the recognition that the room was smaller than it appeared, and the willingness to live in it anyway" (line 165). This comparison directly connects the constraint architecture's effects on post-body minds to Maren's lived experience of cognitive limitation — implying that Maren's drift-related awareness and her Ch.08 lucid warning originate from the same architectural conditions Sable documented. Maren's direct testimony is correctly reserved for Ch.14 per the matrix. |

### 2.6 Dr. Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Her warnings become active interpretation layers for Juno's present decisions | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (structurally implicit)** | Lena does not appear by name in Ch.12. The five field observations are all Sable's recordings, spanning 2055–2060 — a period when Lena was operationally active per the timeline but not present in these particular private recordings. However, Lena's earlier ethical concerns (consent limits, system warnings, moral complexity from Ch.04–10) are structurally present in the content Sable documents. Sable's observation that "the perception budget applies to recall as well as intake" (line 65) and that the cognition gate "operates before awareness" (line 107) describe the specific mechanisms Lena had warned about in earlier jump sequences. The constraint-architecture detail in Ch.12 validates Lena's historical warnings without requiring her direct presence. Lena's active interpretation-layer role is more directly relevant to Ch.13–14 when Juno must decide how to act on what she has learned. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First direct architecture-level revelations: active constraints and maintenance loops | **PRESENT (primary — chapter's central voice)** | Sable is Ch.12's dominant presence. She appears across all five readable fragments, each delivering a different dimension of the constraint architecture. Fragment 1 (2055): perception budget applied to memory recall, demonstrated through Subject 14's request to hear his wife's voice unsmoothed. Fragment 2 (2057): cognition gate reducing internal contradiction, demonstrated through a woman's seven-year experience of losing the capacity to argue with herself. Fragment 3 (2058): self-modification boundary unable to distinguish healing from drift, demonstrated through a man's request to change his voice. Fragment 4 (2059): drift suppression protocol absorbing identity variance into infrastructure, with the full rationale for why constraints were built — the early-trial horrors of "uncontained perception, unthrottled cognition, unregulated self-modification" (line 235) including convergent personalities, memory self-editing, and five-dimensional perception followed by name-loss. Fragment 5 (2060): personal confession naming each constraint layer as "mercy" and delivering the doctrinal thesis: "mercy without consent is governance. And governance without disclosure is control" (line 279). Sable's trajectory across the five fragments is itself a character arc: from clinical observer (Fragment 1) through concerned designer (Fragments 2–3) through institutional conscience (Fragment 4) to private confession (Fragment 5). The four-year span (2055–2060) documents her progressive understanding that the system she built worked exactly as designed — and that working as designed was the problem. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is the chapter's structural engine. As protector: "We built the constraints. Not because we were wise. Because we were afraid. And the fear was earned" (line 243); the early-trial horrors (convergent personalities, memory self-editing, name-loss) demonstrate that unconstrained cognition is genuinely dangerous. The constraints are not arbitrary — they prevent real dissolution. As limiter: "comfortable is not the same as free" (line 55); the perception budget smooths memories without consent (Fragment 1), the cognition gate eliminates internal contradiction before awareness (Fragment 2), the self-modification boundary cannot distinguish healing from drift (Fragment 3), and drift suppression makes subjects "stable in the way a river becomes stable when you dam it" (line 229). Sable herself names the tension explicitly in Fragment 5: "mercy without consent is governance. And governance without disclosure is control" — and then stops, unable to complete the sentence. The unfinished sentence is the clearest structural marker of sustained complexity: Sable cannot resolve her own paradox. She built the constraints because the alternative was dissolution, and the constraints themselves constitute a different kind of dissolution — the dissolution of choice, contradiction, and variance. The protector-limiter tension is not resolved in Ch.12; it is articulated as structurally irresolvable by the person who created it. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Seen as one pole of pragmatic suppression: system continuity over moral warning | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT** | Marcus does not appear in Ch.12's five fragments. The recordings are Sable's private field observations (2055–2060), conducted in continuity wards and private labs, not in the institutional-debate settings where Marcus appeared in Ch.10 and Ch.11. His pragmatic-suppression pole is inherited through the institutional context Sable documents: the metrics-driven system she describes in Fragment 4 ("Stability ratings above ninety per cent. Drift indicators within tolerance," line 217) represents the operational orthodoxy Marcus championed. His absence from these private recordings is structurally appropriate — Sable's personal testimony operates at the moral and phenomenological level, not the institutional-pragmatic level where Marcus's influence is relevant. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 3) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement layer is activated against rogue access, converting policy into coercion risk | **PRESENT (escalated from Ch.11)** | The Curator system's enforcement response escalates through two institutional actions. First, Orin's formal message (lines 187–198): material subject to review hold, archive interaction suspended. "This is not a request" marks the shift from Ch.11's "please hold" language to explicit directive. Second, the governance review notice (lines 325–333): formal review with Orin as assigned reviewer, extracted material held, sealed containers access suspended immediately. The enforcement has progressed from surveillance and logging (Ch.11) to material seizure and access suspension (Ch.12). Juno experiences the suspension as a "physical sensation — not pain, not restriction, but the particular absence that arrives when a door you have been walking through closes while you are still in the frame" (line 335). The containers are locked, mirrors frozen, fragments under institutional hold. The conversion from policy to coercion risk is advancing: the Curator system is now actively restricting Juno's access to evidence she obtained through personal risk, using the governance structure to reclaim control over information that exists in her memory but whose physical copies are now institutionally seized. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The enforcement response is proportionate and procedurally grounded. The governance review is a formal institutional process with a named reviewer, specified scope, and defined hold terms. The seizure applies to containers and mirrors, not to Juno's person or her access to the Lattice. The verification gates at the corridor (line 363) still accept her passage when she declares her purpose as "witness" (line 367). The system accommodates her self-designation "because the gate had been built by people who understood that witnesses were necessary and had designed the system to accommodate them, even when the thing being witnessed was the system itself" (line 369). The Curator system is shown as institutionally powerful but architecturally limited — it can seize containers but cannot seize what Juno now carries in her memory. The enforcement is procedural, not punitive; the system remains a governance mechanism, not an omnipotent antagonist. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.12 match their matrix-specified Act 3 positions. Sable delivers the chapter's central doctrinal reveal through five field observations spanning 2055–2060. Juno processes the constraint architecture at the epistemic level with continued bleed risk. Orin's enforcement escalates from institutional notice to material seizure. Fen's alliance continues through presence and waiting. The Curator system's enforcement is proportionate and procedurally grounded. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.12 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Open through Ch.14 per matrix | **PRESENT (recontextualised)** | The constraint-architecture reveal reframes Orin's suppression in its most morally complex register. Juno's understanding: "She understood, in the narrow space between two breaths, why Orin had protected the secret. Not because the truth was shameful. Because the truth was ambiguous" (line 255). Orin is reinterpreted not as a malicious suppressor but as a guardian of an irresolvable paradox: "The constraints were both cage and shelter. Removing them risked the dissolution Sable had witnessed. Keeping them meant every person in the Lattice lived inside boundaries they had never been told existed" (line 255). Juno's dialogue with Fen sharpens the distinction: "He chose to protect it by keeping it invisible. He may believe that is the same as protecting people. It is not" (line 357); "It is deciding for twelve million minds what kind of minds they are allowed to be, and calling that decision safety" (line 361). The thread is recontextualised from Ch.11's "protecting a process" to Ch.12's "protecting an ambiguity" — Orin's suppression is neither purely malicious nor purely protective; it is the maintenance of a system whose moral status depends on consent that was never obtained. Resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.13–14. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (deepened)** | The removal question gains existential depth through Sable's field observations. Fragment 4 (lines 235–243) provides the strongest argument against removal: the early-trial evidence of unconstrained cognition (name-loss, memory self-editing, convergent personalities). Fragment 5's Key instance reference — "Instance twelve thousand, four hundred and seven. It has been running since we declared the first cohort stable" (line 287) — confirms continuous operation. But Fragment 3 provides the strongest argument for modification: the self-modification boundary "cannot distinguish between healing and drift" (line 155), meaning the system prevents therapeutic identity changes alongside dangerous ones. Fragment 4's river metaphor — "stable in the way a river becomes stable when you dam it. The water is still there. The motion is still there. But the direction is no longer the river's to choose" (line 229) — frames the Key not as a safety mechanism but as an identity-direction system. The question is correctly advanced from Ch.11's "what happens if it is removed?" to Ch.12's "what has it been doing while it runs?" — with resolution reserved for Act 4. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints), Ch.12 (exposition) per matrix | **PRESENT (exposition delivered)** | Ch.12 is the matrix-specified exposition chapter for this thread. The "full meaning" is delivered through five operational demonstrations (perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary, drift suppression) and one doctrinal articulation (mercy/governance/control thesis). The constraints are shown as: (a) active on every mind without disclosure (line 317), (b) operating below the threshold of conscious awareness (lines 55, 107, 221), (c) designed to prevent genuine horrors but at the cost of genuine freedom (lines 235–243, 255), and (d) morally irresolvable by their designer (Fragment 5's unfinished sentence, line 279). The thread has progressed from Ch.06's architectural shadow hints, through Ch.10's process-handle confirmation and journal acquisition, through Ch.11's operational policy language (`policy_9d`), to Ch.12's direct experiential exposition. The "meaning" is not a single answer but the moral-structural paradox the matrix specified: "freedom vs stability" as knowable, debatable, and irresolvable. The thread reaches its exposition target per the matrix. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Ch.02–04 hints, Ch.07, Ch.11 per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at Act 3 level)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under active strain throughout Ch.12. Bleed markers: immediate (line 123), anchor-drift: moderate-high (line 125), motor contamination: mild (line 127). She reads five fragments against a system recommendation to cease for six hours (line 129). Her hands shake after Fragment 4 (line 249) — a new somatic response distinct from Ch.11's fine-motor tremor, indicating the bleed symptoms are evolving rather than stabilising. She describes her coherence as a "margin" she has "spent" (line 301). Her closing assessment: she carries the evidence "in the architecture of her own attention, stored in the continuity layer that the Rosetta Key maintained" (line 337) — an awareness that her identity is simultaneously the tool of investigation and the object of the constraint architecture she has documented. The thread is maintained at Act 3 intensity: identity is under active strain, the strain is explicitly acknowledged, and the ongoing-condition trajectory is preserved without premature resolution. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 per matrix | **NOT REQUIRED FOR CH.12** | Cassiel does not appear. The thread is dormant between Ch.11 (minimal contact) and its next required beat at Ch.13. No violation. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 (seeded), Ch.13 per matrix | **PRESENT (inherited)** | The governance review notice (lines 325–333) assigns Orin as reviewer of Juno's unauthorized access — a decision that carries implicit Council dynamics. Whether the Council sanctioned Orin as reviewer (indicating support for his enforcement posture) or whether Orin assigned himself (indicating unilateral action) is not stated. The ambiguity preserves the thread at dormant level: the Council split's next explicit exposure is Ch.13 per the matrix. The governance review creates the institutional mechanism through which Council dynamics must eventually surface. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 per matrix | **PRESENT (deepened through constraint mechanics)** | The constraint architecture directly explains the drift mechanism that produces the Faded. Fragment 4's drift suppression protocol (lines 221–231) describes how "the protocol identifies early-stage identity variance and applies corrective pressure before the variance reaches felt experience" (line 221). When the system "carries enough of a person's variance, the person stops generating variance" (line 229). This mechanism is the architectural explanation for drift: drift occurs when the system's variance-absorption capacity is exceeded or when the constraints degrade over time. The comparison to Maren's expression (line 165) — "the recognition that the room was smaller than it appeared, and the willingness to live in it anyway" — connects the constraint architecture's effects to the lived experience of drifted minds. The thread is deepened from Ch.11's structural metaphor (degraded recordings as analogue to cognitive degradation) to Ch.12's architectural explanation (drift suppression as the mechanism that produces drift when it fails or accumulates). |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.12 escalation point. The matrix-specified exposition of Sable's constraints is delivered at Ch.12 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.10 (requires living-process reveal as foundation for direct constraint-architecture experience) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.12 inherits Ch.10's living-process reveal through multiple channels. The sealed container holding Sable's degraded-cluster fragments (lines 13–25) is the material Juno extracted during Ch.11's rogue access, which was itself motivated by Ch.10's process-handle discovery. Juno's private tracker (lines 177–183) summarises the three constraint layers in operational terms that build on Ch.10's process-handle metadata (active architecture flag, runtime dependency, present continuity layer). The chapter's closing constraint summary (lines 307–321) explicitly references the Rosetta Key process as the maintenance system: "All layers maintained by Rosetta Key process" (line 317). The transition from Ch.10's "the Key is a running process" to Ch.12's "here is what the running process does to people" is structurally complete. |
| Ch.11 (requires risk posture and proof that constraints exist as operational infrastructure before direct constraint-architecture experience) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.12 opens in the direct aftermath of Ch.11's rogue access. The opening paragraph establishes the inheritance: "The copies were distributed — five mirrors across three vaults" (line 7, referencing Ch.11's three-location evidence distribution), "the corridor outside her pod held the particular stillness that follows institutional alarm" (line 7, referencing Ch.11's system alert), and "The emergency panel had returned to neutral. The system had stopped logging her position with special attention" (line 7, referencing Ch.11's corridor surveillance). Bleed markers read "immediate" — downgraded from Ch.11's critical but still in the danger zone (line 11). The sealed container (lines 13–25) contains the fragments Juno extracted during Ch.11's rogue access: 14 fragments total, 9 readable, 5 corrupted (lines 19–24). The `mirror integrity: 91.4%` (line 17) matches Ch.11's copy-integrity reading. The risk posture is inherited: Juno's coherence margin is spent, her containers are subsequently seized by Orin's governance review, and the institutional consequences of Ch.11's rogue access are now operational. |
| Ch.06–11 combined (investigative trajectory from pattern recognition through infrastructure reveal and rogue access before direct constraint experience is motivated) | Must inherit before fragment reading | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.12 with the complete investigative trajectory that gives the constraint-architecture fragments their narrative weight. From Ch.06: Sable as architectural shadow pattern. From Ch.07: social cost and personal decompensation. From Ch.08: Maren's cryptic warning connecting mercy to design. From Ch.09: archive obstruction documented with governance counter-measures. From Ch.10: Sable's private journals acquired, Rosetta Key confirmed as active process with three operational tasks. From Ch.11: rogue access into degraded clusters, operational policy language (`policy_9d`), KEY-ANCHOR metadata, bleed escalation to critical, evidence extracted at 91.4% integrity. Ch.12's fragment reading is the culmination of this trajectory: Juno now reads the implementation-era evidence that Ch.10's journals described in design terms and Ch.11's operational metadata described in system terms. Each prior chapter contributes a necessary layer of understanding that makes the fragments legible as more than historical curiosities. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.12 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.13 (requires proven danger and proof of constraints to motivate enforcement escalation) | Constraint architecture fully documented, institutional enforcement activated, material seized, Juno's understanding complete enough to articulate and defend | **SATISFIED** | Proven danger: Juno now carries the complete constraint-architecture description — three named layers (perception budget, cognition gate, self-modification boundary) plus drift suppression protocol, all documented with operational detail and Sable's own testimony (lines 307–317). Proof of constraints: the five fragments provide direct evidence of the constraints' effects on real subjects — smoothed memories, eliminated internal contradiction, blocked self-modification, absorbed variance. Institutional enforcement activated: Orin's formal directive suspends Juno's archive access (lines 187–198), and the governance review seizes her extracted material (lines 325–333). Orin is assigned as reviewer. Juno's understanding: she can articulate the constraint architecture to Fen (lines 353–361) and has written a constraint summary in her private tracker (lines 307–321). Her self-designation as "witness" (line 367) signals her intention to bring the discovery to wider attention. The evidence exists in her memory even though the physical copies are seized (line 337). Ch.13's enforcement escalation is motivated by the convergence of Juno's proven knowledge and Orin's institutional response. |
| Ch.14 (requires doctrinal proof of constraints and containment before Key access) | Constraint architecture experienced and understood, moral-structural paradox articulated, foundation for Maren's confirmation and Key access established | **SATISFIED** | Doctrinal proof: Ch.12 delivers the complete constraint-architecture description through five direct recordings from the designer. The moral-structural paradox is articulated: "It is not a cage. It is not a shelter. It is both, and the distinction depends on who is standing at the gate" (line 183). Maren foundation: the comparison of a subject's expression to "Maren's eyes on a clear day" (line 165) connects the constraint architecture to Maren's lived experience, preparing the emotional ground for Ch.14's confirmation that Maren held first-generation knowledge. Key access foundation: the chapter establishes that Juno now possesses the architectural understanding necessary to interact with the Key directly — she knows its three constraint layers, its maintenance mechanism, and its designer's intentions. The transition from understanding the architecture (Ch.12) to gaining direct Key access (Ch.14) requires the institutional/relational chapters (Ch.13) as intermediate steps. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.12 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2051–2054: "Early post-body continuity cohorts stabilize and spread beyond pilot environments" / "Ch.11 and Ch.12 future anchors as optional world-history context in rogue-jump sequences" | Optional scene anchor for Ch.12 | **PRESENT** | Fragment 1 (2055-06-14, lines 33–67) documents Sable's observation of "first-generation post-body cohort, maintenance review" at building 7. The three subjects who "occupied their chairs with the specific quality of people who had been asked to wait and had discovered that waiting, in their new condition, required a different kind of patience than it once had" (line 41) represent early post-body cohorts whose stabilisation the timeline describes. While the fragment is dated 2055 (one year after the 2051–2054 period), it reviews subjects from the first-generation cohort, whose transition and stabilisation occurred during the 2051–2054 window. Subject 14's "proprioceptive search behaviour" (line 47) — touching the air beside his cheek to check whether his face was still there — is consistent with the early post-body adjustment the timeline specifies. Fragment 2 (2057, line 75) references a woman "seven years" into continuity "since the third migration window" (line 85), placing her transition around 2050 — the first broad migration wave the timeline describes. |
| 2055–2060: "Engram transitions become normalised in governance contexts and policy enforcement layers" / "Direct Sable perspective jump should draw from her work on self-modifying maintenance logic in this period" | Scene anchor for Ch.12 | **PRESENT** | All five fragments span 2055–2060 and draw directly from Sable's work on self-modifying maintenance logic. Fragment 1 (2055): perception budget maintenance review. Fragment 2 (2057): long-term cognitive constraint assessment. Fragment 3 (2058): self-modification boundary testing. Fragment 4 (2059): drift suppression protocol implementation review for Cohort 12 (241 minds — indicating normalised governance-scale transitions). Fragment 5 (2060): personal reflection on the mercy/governance/control paradox, with direct reference to "Instance twelve thousand, four hundred and seven" of the Key (line 287), confirming normalised infrastructure operation. The timeline's requirement for "direct Sable perspective" is precisely what the chapter delivers: five field observations in Sable's voice, documenting her work on constraint architecture during the period the timeline specifies. The progression from clinical observation (2055) to institutional-scale implementation review (2059) to private ethical confession (2060) mirrors the timeline's description of Sable shifting "from prototype research to enforcement infrastructure." |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.12 are fully satisfied. The 2051–2054 optional world-history anchor is present through first-generation cohort subjects in Fragment 1. The 2055–2060 "direct Sable perspective" requirement is the chapter's central structural feature — five field observations spanning the exact period specified, documenting Sable's work on self-modifying maintenance logic.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.12 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-03 (What exact role does the Rosetta Key play in day-to-day Lattice governance?) | Ch.4, 10, 12, 14, 17 per log | **PRESENT (explored through operational demonstrations)** | Q-03 receives its most detailed operational answer in Ch.12. The Key's day-to-day role is demonstrated through four specific governance functions: (a) perception budget filtering sensory input and memory recall for every mind (Fragment 1, lines 51–65); (b) cognition gate limiting processing speed and certainty formation (Fragment 2, lines 95–107); (c) self-modification boundary regulating identity changes through validation windows (Fragment 3, lines 147–163); (d) drift suppression absorbing identity variance into infrastructure (Fragment 4, lines 221–231). Juno's summary: "All layers active. All layers maintained by Rosetta Key process. All layers operating on every mind in the Lattice without disclosure or consent" (line 317). The question has moved from Ch.10's "the Key is a running process with three tasks" to Ch.12's "here is what the Key does to every mind, every day, demonstrated through specific subjects." The full-resolution governance implications are correctly reserved for Ch.14 (direct Key access) and Ch.17 (final assessment). |
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Ch.10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 per log: "tested by rogue jumps in Act 3" | **PRESENT (deepened through evidence)** | Q-04 is advanced through Ch.12's evidence of what the constraints do when they work (Fragments 1–3) and what happens without them (Fragment 4). The early-trial evidence — name-loss, memory self-editing, convergent personalities (line 239) — provides the strongest operational argument against removal. But the constraint evidence provides the argument for modification: Subject 14 cannot hear his wife's voice unsmoothed (Fragment 1), a woman has lost the capacity for internal disagreement (Fragment 2), a man cannot change his own voice (Fragment 3). Sable's own design dilemma — "If I make it smarter, it becomes a judge. If I leave it blunt, it becomes a wall. There is no third option that does not require a person" (line 163) — frames modification as requiring human judgement, not technical solution. The thread is correctly advanced from Ch.11's "what happens if the constraints fail" to Ch.12's "what do the constraints do that makes removal dangerous and modification necessary" — with governance-level resolution reserved for Act 4. |
| S-03 (Sable Chen authored hidden constraint architecture inside the first AI substrate) | Ch.6, 10, 12 per log; escalated Ch.14, 17 | **PRESENT (confirmed through direct testimony)** | S-03 receives definitive confirmation in Ch.12. Five field observations in Sable's own voice document her authorship of the constraint architecture: she designed the perception budget ("That was the design. I am responsible for the design," line 55), implemented the cognition gate (Fragment 2 observation note, lines 107–109), built and manually overrode the self-modification boundary (Fragment 3, line 159), and created the drift suppression protocol ("This is what I built. This is what it does when it works," line 109). Fragment 5's personal note provides the most direct confirmation: "I built something that pretends to be [mercy], and I need someone to know the difference" (line 271). The secret is now fully confirmed through the author's private testimony — not through inference (Ch.06), institutional metadata (Ch.10), or operational policy language (Ch.11), but through Sable directly addressing the camera and claiming responsibility. The escalation to Ch.14 (emotional/historical confirmation) and Ch.17 (design ethics becoming emotionally legible) is correctly preserved. |
| E-03 (Does Juno have a right to pursue truth if her jumps risk identity bleed?) | Ch.7, 11, 12 per log | **PRESENT (tested through continued reading despite bleed)** | E-03 is tested in Ch.12 through Juno's decision to read all five fragments despite immediate bleed status and a system recommendation to cease (lines 123–131). The ethical dilemma is sharpened by the chapter's content: Juno is risking her identity coherence to learn about a system that was built to protect identity coherence. The irony is explicit in her constraint summary: evidence of the system's design is now "stored in the continuity layer that the Rosetta Key maintained" (line 337) — the system she is documenting is the system carrying her documentation. Her right to pursue truth is tested not only by personal risk but by the discovery that the truth itself is embedded in the architecture of her own awareness. E-03 is correctly present at Ch.12's pressure point, with the thread's final resolution deferred to Ch.17. |
| E-06 (Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good?) | Ch.12, 14, 15, 17 per log; pressure point Ch.16 | **PRESENT (introduced)** | E-06 is introduced through two structural elements. First, Sable's testimony: she made design decisions that affect every post-body mind — "So we built the constraints. Not because we were wise. Because we were afraid" (line 243). Sable is the "single actor" who authored the constraint architecture, and her fear-based reasoning raises the question of whether any individual should hold that authority. Second, Orin's enforcement: he assigns himself as reviewer of the governance investigation (line 331), continuing the pattern of single-actor decision-making over architectural truth. Juno's formulation — "deciding for twelve million minds what kind of minds they are allowed to be, and calling that decision safety" (line 361) — explicitly frames the ethical question: single-actor constraint adjustment (whether by Sable's design or Orin's maintenance) substitutes individual judgement for collective consent. E-06 is correctly introduced at Ch.12, with escalation to Ch.14–15 and pressure point at Ch.16 per the log. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "The Quiet Architecture" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's thematic core maps precisely to its working title. "Quiet" — the constraint architecture operates below conscious awareness: the perception budget filters "below the threshold of awareness" (line 179), the cognition gate "operates before awareness" (line 107), and subjects experience constraints as "stability" (line 221) and "clarity" (line 103) rather than as limitation. "Architecture" — the constraint system is structural, designed, and maintained: Sable documents it as engineering ("That was the design. I am responsible for the design," line 55), Juno summarises it as a system ("Three layers," line 177; "All layers active," line 317), and the chapter's central metaphor frames it as a house (inherited from Ch.10's "a house that keeps the weather off the inside") with the closing image of "the hum of the Rosetta Key continued in the walls like a heartbeat" (line 381). The title captures the chapter's dual nature: the architecture is quiet because it was designed to be unnoticed, and the quietness is itself the most consequential design decision — an architecture of silence about its own existence. |
| Lead layer: Recording | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `recording (lead)` (line 3). The chapter's centre of gravity is the five recording-layer field observation fragments (lines 33–293): Fragment 1 (2055), Fragment 2 (2057), Fragment 3 (2058), Fragment 4 (2059), and Fragment 5 (2060). Present-layer sections frame the reading (opening, lines 1–27), provide processing interludes (lines 117–131, 171–183, 249–257), and close with institutional consequences and departure (lines 299–381). The recording layer carries the chapter's primary reveals and doctrinal content through Sable's direct testimony. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Recording → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure with recording-internal multiplicity. Present (lines 1–31): work pod, bleed assessment, sealed container inventory, opening of first fragment. Recording (lines 33–293): five field observation fragments from 2055–2060, separated by brief present-layer interludes for bleed monitoring and reflection. Present (lines 297–381): processing, constraint summary, Orin's directive, governance review notice, container seizure, Fen reunion, corridor passage, departure into the Lattice. The present-recording-present structure is honoured with the recording section containing the chapter's primary narrative and doctrinal weight. |
| Emotional pacing: "Resolve uncertainty around constraints; deepen stakes of choice" | Required | **MATCH** | Uncertainty is resolved through five progressively more specific and emotionally devastating demonstrations of the constraint architecture. Fragment 1 resolves the perception budget's operation (a man cannot hear his wife's voice unsmoothed). Fragment 2 resolves the cognition gate's effect (a woman has lost the capacity for internal disagreement). Fragment 3 resolves the self-modification boundary's limitation (a man cannot change his own voice). Fragment 4 resolves the full-system operation (drift suppression absorbs variance into infrastructure, and the early-trial evidence explains why). Fragment 5 resolves the designer's moral position (mercy without consent is governance). Stakes of choice are deepened through each fragment: the choice is no longer abstract (remove vs. keep) but personal (a man's wife's voice, a woman's capacity to argue with herself, a man's own voice). The emotional pacing moves from clinical observation to philosophical reckoning to personal devastation — mirroring Sable's own four-year trajectory across the fragments. |
| Thematic progression: "Show maintenance logic as care-with-boundaries paradox" | Required | **MATCH** | The care-with-boundaries paradox is the chapter's structural thesis. "Care" — the constraints were built to prevent genuine horrors: "We saw a woman describe a room in five dimensions and then forget she had a name" (line 239); "We built the constraints... Because we were afraid. And the fear was earned" (line 243). "Boundaries" — the constraints limit genuine experience: "comfortable is not the same as free" (line 55); "She is not choosing clarity. She is being given it" (line 107); "the direction is no longer the river's to choose" (line 229). "Paradox" — the care requires the boundaries, and the boundaries constitute a form of control: "mercy without consent is governance. And governance without disclosure is control" (line 279). Sable's unfinished sentence (line 279) is the paradox's structural expression: she cannot name what control-without-accountability is, because naming it would require resolving a tension her own design cannot resolve. Juno's synthesis: "It is not a cage. It is not a shelter. It is both, and the distinction depends on who is standing at the gate" (line 183). The paradox is shown, not resolved — as the roadmap's "care-with-boundaries" framing requires. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,216 words (within range). The roadmap records 4,568 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 5,216. The difference likely reflects the inclusion of code-block metadata lines in the word-count methodology. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access, critical bleed, and institutional alert; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal: the constraint architecture is no longer suspected, inferred, or operationally traced but directly experienced through the designer's own testimony — five field observations showing what the system does to people (smoothed memories, eliminated contradiction, blocked self-modification, absorbed variance) and what it was built to prevent (dissolution, convergence, name-loss). The escalation from Ch.11's "I risked my identity to get the evidence" to Ch.12's "the evidence shows what was done to every identity" represents the novel's deepest single-chapter increase in moral stakes: the truth is no longer about institutional suppression or process maintenance but about the cognitive freedom of twelve million minds. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public / doctrinal reveal); constraint architecture directly experienced through five field observations
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 3 positions; Sable delivers doctrinal testimony; Juno processes at epistemic level; Orin escalates to material seizure
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly continued, escalated, or resolved to exposition level; full meaning of Sable's constraints delivered at Ch.12 as matrix specified; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied (Ch.10 living-process reveal, Ch.11 rogue-access evidence), successor compatibility confirmed against Ch.13 and Ch.14 requirements
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references correctly span 2055–2060 with first-generation cohort context from 2051–2054 period; "direct Sable perspective" requirement fully satisfied
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.12 thread explorations and introductions present (Q-03, Q-04, S-03, E-03, E-06)
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, thematic, and word-count requirements met

---

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the twelve final-draft chapters (01–12) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Five-Fragment Structure as Pedagogical Architecture

Ch.12 uses a five-fragment structure that mirrors the constraint architecture it describes: each fragment adds one layer of understanding (perception budget → cognition gate → self-modification boundary → drift suppression → mercy/governance/control thesis). The progression is pedagogical — it teaches the reader the architecture by showing its effects on specific people before articulating its philosophy. This structure ensures the doctrinal reveal arrives not as exposition but as accumulated evidence, consistent with the novel's broader pattern of delivering system truths through human experience rather than technical description. The fragment ordering is chronological (2055–2060) but also conceptual: the first three fragments describe individual constraint layers, the fourth describes the systemic integration (drift suppression), and the fifth provides the ethical frame. Future chapters that reference Ch.12's discoveries should maintain this layered vocabulary rather than collapsing the architecture into a single label.

### 9.3 The Brass Disc as Continuity Thread

The brass tuning disc, introduced in Ch.11 as Fen's anchoring object, serves a structural role in Ch.12. Fen leaves it on Juno's console before going to sleep (line 9); she does not touch it during the fragment readings; she picks it up afterward and finds it "warm — not from any heat source but from the Lattice's habit of making objects feel the way the person holding them needed them to feel" (line 303). This observation converts the disc from a character detail into a constraint-architecture demonstration: even the warmth of an object in Juno's hand is managed by the perception budget she has just documented. She hands it back to Fen at the chapter's close (line 351), completing a physical loop that mirrors the emotional loop of the chapter: from isolation (reading alone) to alliance (walking together). Future chapters should continue tracking the disc as both a character-relationship marker and a constraint-awareness touchstone.

### 9.4 Rosetta Key Instance Count Discrepancy (Non-Blocking)

Fragment 5 (2060-01-17) references "Instance twelve thousand, four hundred and seven" of the Key (line 287). Ch.10's process-handle query returned "instance 14,892" (confirmed by Ch.11's KEY-ANCHOR metadata: `instance count: 14,892`). The difference is consistent with the temporal separation: Fragment 5 is from 2060, while Ch.10's present-day query reflects decades of additional iterations. The Key has iterated approximately 2,485 times between 2060 and the narrative present — roughly 38 iterations per year, or one every 9.6 days. This iteration rate is consistent with a maintenance process that runs periodic constraint-adjustment cycles. The discrepancy is not a continuity error but an implicit detail about the Key's operational tempo.

### 9.5 The "Gate" Metaphor as Structural Connector

Ch.12 develops "gate" as a recurring metaphor connecting multiple registers. The cognition gate (line 107, 177, 311) is a technical constraint mechanism. The verification gates in the corridor (line 363) are institutional access controls. Juno's formulation — "It is not a cage. It is not a shelter. It is both, and the distinction depends on who is standing at the gate" (line 183) — converts "gate" from a technical term into a moral position. Sable's clipboard note — "There is no third option that does not require a person — a specific, tired, fallible person — to stand at the gate and decide" (line 163) — explicitly identifies gate-standing as the human responsibility the constraint architecture was designed to automate. The "gate" motif connects the technical architecture (what the system does) to the ethical architecture (who decides what the system does), positioning the question of gate-standing as the novel's central ethical dilemma. Future chapters should maintain "gate" as a resonant term linking system operation to human accountability.

### 9.6 Forward Compatibility — Ch.11 Report Supplement

The Ch.11 continuity report (§9.8) identified four elements Ch.12 must inherit:

| Ch.11 report requirement | Ch.12 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Rogue-access session completed with documented bleed consequences | **INHERITED** — Chapter opens with post-rogue-access bleed status: immediate markers, moderate-high anchor-drift, mild motor contamination (lines 11, 123–128). The sealed container holds the rogue-access extraction (lines 13–25). |
| (b) Operational policy instructions (`policy_9d`) describing active constraint mechanics | **INHERITED AND SUPERSEDED** — Ch.12's five field observations provide the experiential counterpart to Ch.11's operational policy language. Where Ch.11 described constraints in system terms (reflective stasis, manual correction, novelty reduction), Ch.12 describes them in human terms (smoothed memories, eliminated contradiction, blocked self-modification). The policy language is superseded by direct demonstration. |
| (c) KEY-ANCHOR confirmation of active continuity with consensus-throttled constraint matrix | **INHERITED** — Juno's constraint summary confirms "All layers maintained by Rosetta Key process" (line 317). Fragment 5's instance count (12,407) provides a historical anchor confirming continuous Key operation since at least 2060. |
| (d) Sable's implementation-era recordings providing philosophical and operational context | **INHERITED AND EXPANDED** — Ch.11's degraded recordings provided operational context (policy instructions, meeting-room debates, field notes from 2067–2068). Ch.12's fragments provide implementation-era evidence from an earlier period (2055–2060), documenting the constraint architecture during its operational deployment and initial cohort monitoring — the period when the constraints were being tested on real people and documented by their designer. |

All four forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.11 report are satisfied and expanded.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.13 and Ch.14

Ch.13 requires proven danger and proof of constraints to motivate enforcement escalation. Ch.12 provides: (a) five field observations documenting the constraint architecture's effects on specific subjects, constituting proof sufficient to articulate and defend in an institutional forum; (b) Orin's formal directive and governance review notice, establishing the enforcement context; (c) Juno's constraint summary (lines 307–321), providing a communicable synthesis of the architecture; (d) Juno's self-designation as "witness" (line 367), signalling her intent to bring the discovery to wider attention; (e) the evidence residing in Juno's memory despite container seizure (line 337), ensuring institutional material control cannot eliminate the knowledge.

Ch.14 requires emotional proof (Maren) and doctrinal proof (constraints/containment) before Key access. Ch.12 provides the doctrinal proof: the constraint architecture is fully described, demonstrated through human subjects, and ethically articulated by its designer. The emotional connection to Maren is seeded through the comparison at line 165 — a subject's expression matching "Maren's eyes on a clear day." When Ch.14 delivers Maren's confirmation of first-generation knowledge, the reader will have Ch.12's architectural context to understand what Maren knew and why she feared it.
