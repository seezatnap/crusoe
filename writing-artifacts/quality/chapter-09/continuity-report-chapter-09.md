## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-09.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-09.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 09 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Restricted archive barriers are concretely encountered | **PRESENT** | Archive barriers are the chapter's structural engine. The corridor narrows with new identity checks and occupancy verifications (lines 7–9). Eleven EN-33 entries are reclassified to `CURATED / NO PROVENANCE / DEFERRED INDEFINITELY` (lines 21–22). All eleven return `ACCESS DENIED` with `Curator-level hold. Active curation in progress` (lines 29–33). Provenance chains reveal `archive-silent` disposition notation — permanent inaccessibility (lines 143–145). The barriers are concrete, documented, and structurally consequential. |
| Orin deflection documented | **PRESENT** | Orin's deflection operates across multiple registers. His initial message frames the reclassification as "standard procedural action consistent with preservation law" (line 69). His rapid reply asserts "Access limitations are procedural, not disciplinary" (line 95). In person, he deflects: "Archive-silent is a preservation tool" (line 251), "Those hearings contained testimony that could be misinterpreted" (line 263), and "If I release those entries, the record will not speak. It will shout" (line 273). He frames silence as protection: "Some truths require preparation before they can be held without damage" (line 217). His deflection is documented through institutional language, in-person confrontation, and governance protocols — the chapter maps the full anatomy of how a Curator converts suppression into procedure. |
| Reveal status: "Public / frictional reveal" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter converts abstract policy friction into concrete, documented obstruction. Juno encounters the barriers directly (eleven denials), traces their provenance to Orin's authority code (line 53), identifies the `archive-silent` disposition (lines 143–145), files a governance referral with Tamsin (lines 163–176), and confronts Orin in person (lines 235–338). The friction is public — it generates institutional records (Tamsin filing, advisory consultation chain) that cannot be archive-silenced without countersignature (lines 189, 309–317). The reveal validates suspecting suppression: Orin's non-denial of Sable content ("I cannot confirm or deny the content of entries under active Curator hold," line 329) is read by Juno as "confirmation enough" (line 331). The reveal status correctly combines public documentation with frictional confrontation — the truth is being forced out through structural pressure, not voluntary disclosure. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.09 is present at the correct reveal status. The chapter functions as the frictional-reveal chapter described in the matrix, converting abstract access-control policy into active, documented obstruction with institutional counter-measures.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Obsession becomes visible in work habits and behavior around Orin | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's obsession has evolved from investigative fixation (Ch.06–07) and emotional processing (Ch.08) into institutional confrontation. She methodically tests all eleven denied entries (lines 37–41), analyses the reclassification pattern as deliberate curation targeting governance-hearing friction points (lines 119–127), circumvents Orin's authority by filing through the independent governance liaison (lines 157–176), and directly confronts Orin with provenance evidence (lines 259–260). Her work habits are now driven by the investigation's structural logic — she is not merely obsessed but strategically persistent. |
| Bleed starts to affect ordinary decision-making | **CONSISTENT (muted)** | Bleed is present but subdued in Ch.09 relative to Ch.07–08. The console's nothing feels "granular" (line 13) — a textural shift indicating the system has changed beneath her. She feels phantom warmth on the console ("slightly warmer under her palms — a phantom sensation," line 99). She walks the corridor "not for exercise, not for a destination, but because walking was the only physical action the Lattice allowed her to perform without the architecture asking for a reason" (line 153). The muted bleed is structurally appropriate: Ch.09's lead layer is present-Lattice with no recording jumps, so bleed symptoms manifest as architectural sensitivity rather than sensory intrusion. The chapter's energy is directed outward (institutional confrontation) rather than inward (bleed processing), marking a correct Act 2 shift from private cost to public action. |
| She keeps risk hidden, creating stress fractures in trust | **EVOLVING (correctly)** | Ch.09 marks a further transition from partial disclosure (Ch.07) toward strategic transparency. Juno's private tracker notes include "Do not discuss specifics with Fen or Cassiel until governance liaison confirms scope" (line 201) — she is strategically withholding, not reflexively hiding. After the Orin confrontation, she sends Fen a substantive briefing: "Eleven entries archive-silenced. Filed governance referral. Orin confirmed chain but will not release without Council review" (line 351). She sends Cassiel a message framing her location rather than requesting rescue: "I found the edge of what the archive is willing to show me, and the edge has Orin's signature on it" (line 357). The stress fractures are present but managed — she communicates through governance structures rather than personal confession. |
| Risk: obsession shown too early | **NO VIOLATION** | Obsession in Ch.09 is at the correct intensity for late Act 2. The chapter shows institutional confrontation — Juno uses procedural tools (governance referral, provenance analysis, advisory consultation chain) rather than emotional escalation. She does not break protocol or take rogue action. Her persistence is strategic, not compulsive. The chapter correctly positions her at the boundary between investigation and activism — she has created "two structural facts that could not be archive-silenced" (line 365) without yet crossing into the rogue-jump behaviour reserved for Act 3 (Ch.11). |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Restrictive responses and selective omissions accumulate | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | Ch.09 represents Orin's most significant restrictive action in the final-draft sequence. He reclassifies eleven EN-33 entries to Curator-hold with `archive-silent` disposition (lines 141–149) — a term that "had not been invoked in living memory" (line 145). His messages deploy institutional language as deflection: "standard procedural action" (line 69), "procedural, not disciplinary" (line 95), "preservation law and chain integrity requirements" (line 69). In person, he frames silence as protection: "Some truths require preparation before they can be held without damage" (line 217). His selective omissions are now measurable — Juno identifies that the eleven sealed entries correspond to governance-hearing segments where "the architecture had been forced to explain itself" (line 125). The accumulation has crossed from pattern to documented evidence. |
| Protective posture hardens under increased scrutiny | **PRESENT** | Orin's posture hardens across the chapter's three-stage confrontation. Stage 1 (messages): institutional language with no personal register. Stage 2 (in-person meeting): initial composure thins — "The composure was thinner. The distance between his words was slightly longer" (line 243). He defends silence: "If I release those entries, the record will not speak. It will shout" (line 273). Stage 3 (post-confrontation): he makes a tactical concession (advisory consultation chain, line 309) but refuses to reverse the reclassification without Council review (line 293). His protective posture has moved from social distance (Ch.03), through selective enablement (Ch.06), through institutional procedure (Ch.08), to active suppression with governance justification (Ch.09). The hardening is directional and responsive to Juno's escalating pressure. |
| No overexposure of intentions before Juno's evidence is solid | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain ambiguous despite the confrontation. His central claim — "mercy has a mechanism, and the mechanism has a cost, and the cost has been paid by everyone alive without their knowledge or consent" (line 277) — reveals the *stakes* of the sealed records without revealing their *content*. His motives are presented through Juno's assessment as "the exhausted certainty of a person who had carried a secret long enough to believe the carrying was the secret's purpose" (line 271) — not confirmed, but credible. He is neither pure villain nor justified protector. The reader understands that he is suppressing specific records but does not yet know whether the suppression serves the polity or only Orin's authority. Ambiguity is correctly preserved at the late-Act-2 level. |

### 2.3 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| First risk alarm role emerges as Juno's behavior degrades | **CONSISTENT (maintained)** | Fen does not appear in person in Ch.09 but receives Juno's most substantive briefing to date: the full governance referral details, advisory consultation status, and institutional framing ("The wall is institutional, not personal. We need to prepare for what happens when the Council decides whether to open it," line 353). Fen's alarm role has transitioned from direct intervention (Ch.07) through co-witnessing (Ch.08) to informed alliance (Ch.09). The role is maintained through communication rather than presence — appropriate for a chapter focused on Juno's institutional confrontation rather than interpersonal dynamics. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's absence from the chapter's direct action is consistent with the chapter's institutional focus. The briefing message maintains the relationship's established communication pattern without requiring Fen to be physically present for institutional confrontation that is Juno's alone to conduct. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Returns from distance and re-enters conflict, creating friction and hope in equal measure | **CONSISTENT (maintained)** | Cassiel receives the second briefing message: "I did not disappear. I found the edge of what the archive is willing to show me, and the edge has Orin's signature on it. I am not asking for rescue. I am telling you where I am so that if the room moves, someone outside it knows the shape" (line 357). The message's language — "not asking for rescue" combined with "someone outside it knows the shape" — maintains the friction-and-hope balance established in Ch.07. Cassiel functions as an external witness who is informed but not summoned, preserving his independence while acknowledging Juno's reliance on the support network negotiated in Ch.07. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc from "defensive presentism" to "ethical partnership" paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's role in Ch.09 is appropriately minimal. The chapter's action belongs to Juno and Orin. Cassiel's function is witness-at-distance, consistent with the conditional terms negotiated in Ch.07 (witness without canvas, no art rescue). The arc has not advanced toward ethical partnership — that development is reserved for Ch.13 per the matrix. Pacing is correct. |

### 2.5 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Opaque lucid moment introduces a pre-seeded reference (Ch.08 per matrix) | **DELIVERED IN CH.08; INHERITED IN CH.09** | Maren does not appear directly in Ch.09. Her Ch.08 lucid warning is inherited through its consequences: Juno's investigation has been shaped by Maren's language about "returns" and "mechanisms" and "mercy renamed as design" (Ch.08 lines 143, 165, 179). The governance-hearing gaps Juno discovers in Ch.09 (2042–2044 institutional-split period, line 119) correspond to the period when the constraints Maren described were being formalised. Maren's influence is present as investigative context rather than direct appearance — correctly positioned for late Act 2 where Maren's lucid-moment content is being tested against institutional evidence. |

### 2.6 Lena Orlov

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Thread gains moral complexity: ethical costs, consent limits, and early system warnings | **CONSISTENT (inherited)** | Lena does not appear directly in Ch.09 (the chapter contains no recording-layer sequences). However, her presence persists through the provenance chain: Lena's "original filing signature from 2044" sits at the top of the EN-33-041 chain (line 137). The entries Orin has sealed correspond to governance hearings where the Engram team — including Lena — "was asked about constraints, about design parameters, about the difference between what the system could do and what it had been permitted to do" (lines 120–121). Lena's moral complexity is indirectly present: the records being suppressed are precisely those where ethical costs, consent limits, and system warnings were articulated. Her absence from direct appearance is structurally appropriate — Ch.09 focuses on present-layer institutional dynamics rather than recording-layer historical testimony. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Moves from hint to trace evidence, especially around hidden safeguards and anomaly logs | **CONSISTENT (maintained)** | Sable is not directly present in Ch.09 but functions as the investigative target of the entire chapter. Juno's direct question — "Tell me whether the eleven entries contain testimony from Sable Chen" (line 325) — identifies Sable as the content behind the sealed records. Orin's non-denial ("I cannot confirm or deny," line 329) is read as confirmation (line 331). The reclassified entries occupy the temporal band "when Sable Chen's private journals overlapped with Marcus Fell's expansion contracts" (line 25). The sealed governance-hearing segments correspond to moments when "the architecture had been forced to explain itself" (line 125) — exactly the kind of constraint-design testimony Sable would have provided. Sable has transitioned from internalised residue (Ch.07), through notebook fragments (Ch.08), to the object of institutional suppression (Ch.09). The trace-evidence trajectory continues to escalate toward Ch.10's direct acquisition. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's complexity is maintained through the chapter's framing of the sealed records. Orin's defence — "the boundaries were designed by people who understood that without them, digital consciousness would not survive its own capacity for expansion" (line 277) — implicitly positions Sable's constraint architecture as protective. Juno's counter — "That is not a reason to seal the record. That is a reason to open it carefully" (line 283) — reframes the same architecture as something that deserves public scrutiny rather than permanent concealment. The protector-limiter tension is now operating at the institutional level: the question is no longer whether Sable's constraints were protective or limiting, but whether the institutional system built to maintain them has become a form of suppression. Complexity is sustained through the gap between design intent and governance consequence. |

### 2.8 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 2) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Selective curation methods become visibly interventionist through missing/deleted entries | **PRESENT (major escalation)** | The Curator system's interventionism reaches its most explicit expression in Ch.09. Eleven entries reclassified simultaneously, all bearing the same temporal-band pattern (lines 21–25). `Archive-silent` disposition invoked — "permanent inaccessibility: not deleted, not destroyed, but buried so deep in the governance layer that no standard request could reach it" (lines 145–146). Orin's authority code on all eleven reclassifications (line 53). The corridor itself has changed its shape: new identity checks, occupancy verifications, chain-of-custody declarations (lines 7–8). Governance-hearing segments sealed at exactly the points where design constraints were being questioned (lines 119–125). The system's interventionism is no longer implicit — it is documented, traced, and structurally challenged. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The Curator system's actions remain defensible within its own logic. Orin's justifications are procedurally correct: "Reclassification authority is vested in the Curator Office under Sections 14 and 17 of the Archive Governance Charter" (line 95). His emotional defence — fear of what unrestricted disclosure would produce (lines 273–277) — is presented as sincere. His tactical concession (the advisory consultation chain, lines 307–317) demonstrates that the system retains internal accountability mechanisms. Tamsin's independent liaison office exists "precisely for moments when the Curator order's actions needed external verification" (line 158). Juno's governance referral creates "a governance record that cannot be reclassified by the Curator Office without independent countersignature" (line 189). The system is shown as powerful and protective, but not omnipotent — it contains structural checks that can be activated by persistent individual action. The Curator system is antagonistic in function but not villainous in character. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.09 match their matrix-specified Act 2 positions. Orin undergoes the expected major escalation from selective enablement to active suppression with documented justification. Juno's investigative persistence matures from emotional-pattern-tracking to institutional confrontation. The Curator system's interventionism becomes explicit and documented. Sable functions as the implicit object of suppression. No premature escalation, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.09 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Ch.09 per matrix (explicit seed point) | **PRESENT (major development)** | This thread is Ch.09's primary narrative engine. Orin's suppression is now documented through provenance chains (line 53), archive-silent disposition (lines 143–145), and institutional language (lines 69, 95). His in-person defence presents the suppression as protective: "mercy has a mechanism, and the mechanism has a cost, and the cost has been paid by everyone alive without their knowledge or consent" (line 277). Juno reads beneath this: "the exhausted certainty of a person who had carried a secret long enough to believe the carrying was the secret's purpose" (line 271). The thread is explicitly present and correctly unresolved — Orin's motives remain genuinely ambiguous between protective caution and institutional self-preservation. The matrix specifies resolution at Ch.13–14; Ch.09 correctly maintains the tension at maximum visibility without premature closure. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Continued from Ch.02–08 | **PRESENT (subdued)** | Identity stability in Ch.09 is expressed through architectural sensitivity rather than sensory bleed. The console's "granularity" (line 13), phantom warmth (line 99), and the corridor's perceived change (lines 343–345) indicate that Juno's perceptual relationship to the Lattice has been altered by sustained stress. Her walking the corridor "because walking was the only physical action the Lattice allowed her to perform without the architecture asking for a reason" (line 153) suggests she is testing the boundary between self and system. The thread is maintained at appropriate intensity — Ch.09's focus on institutional action correctly deprioritises internal bleed dynamics in favour of external confrontation, with the identity-stability thread continuing as background texture. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Ch.06–10 (hints) per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced)** | Ch.09 advances the constraint thread from investigative pattern (Ch.06), through internalised residue (Ch.07) and notebook confirmation (Ch.08), to institutional suppression of the constraint record itself. The sealed entries target governance hearings where "the architecture had been forced to explain itself" (line 125) — the moments where constraints were debated, designed, and justified. Orin's defence implicitly confirms that the constraints exist and are consequential: "the boundaries were designed by people who understood that without them, digital consciousness would not survive its own capacity for expansion" (line 277). The meaning is advanced but not yet fully exposed — Juno knows constraints exist and that their documentary record is being actively suppressed, but has not yet directly experienced the constraint architecture (reserved for Ch.12). Correctly positioned within the Ch.06–10 hint range. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09 per matrix (seeded) | **PRESENT** | The Council split is seeded through Orin's admission: "I cannot reverse the reclassification without a Council review" (line 293). His subsequent statement — "A Council review will produce questions I am not authorised to answer on the public record" (line 297) — reveals that the Council's relationship to the sealed information is itself contested terrain. The reclassification was made under Orin's individual authority, not Council mandate, implying either unilateral action or implicit backing from a subset of the Council. Juno's demand — "Then request the review" (line 295) — tests whether Orin's authority represents Council consensus or personal conviction. The thread is correctly seeded: the Council's internal dynamics are implied but not yet visible. Per the matrix, explicit exposure is reserved for Ch.13. |
| Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed? (Q-05) | Ch.09 per unresolved-thread-log | **PRESENT (primary)** | Ch.09 directly answers Q-05's introduction requirement. The entries are not deleted — "the Lattice did not delete in ways that left clean holes" (line 21). They are reclassified through multiple stages: accessible → restricted → suppressed → `CURATED / NO PROVENANCE / DEFERRED INDEFINITELY` (line 21). The `archive-silent` disposition means "not deleted, not destroyed, but buried so deep in the governance layer that no standard request could reach it" (lines 145–146). The distinction between deletion and suppression is explicit and structural. The question of "repurposed" remains open — the records still exist within the system but have been rendered unreachable. |
| What is the true boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure? (Q-06) | Ch.09 per unresolved-thread-log | **PRESENT** | The boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure is tested through the provenance chain analysis. Lena's 2044 filing signature sits at the top of the chain (line 137); Orin's current-cycle reclassifications sit at the bottom (lines 141–142). The chain reveals that historical records are not inert memory but active governance objects — subject to reclassification, disposition changes, and access control by present-day authority. The "secondary index" that tracks provenance chains "belonged to the Archive's structural maintenance layer" (line 133) — a living infrastructure component that cannot be manipulated without triggering alerts. The boundary is shown as porous: historical records are living governance instruments, and their accessibility is a function of present political decisions. |
| What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control? (Q-07) | Ch.09 per unresolved-thread-log | **PRESENT (escalated)** | Q-07 reaches its most explicit formulation in Ch.09. Orin frames the Curator function as preservation: "Archive-silent is a preservation tool" (line 251). Juno reframes it as control: "Designed to make records unreachable" (line 253). The confrontation's core exchange — Orin: "The intent here is preservation" / Juno: "The charter is specific about intent" (lines 255–256) — directly tests whether Curator authority is preservative or controlling. The governance referral to Tamsin introduces an independent oversight mechanism, testing whether the Curator layer's authority is self-regulating or requires external checks. The function question is now explicitly framed as a governance dilemma rather than a character assessment. |
| Archive access controls can be politically weaponized (S-06) | Ch.09 per unresolved-thread-log | **PRESENT (escalated)** | S-06 reaches its most concrete expression in Ch.09. The eleven reclassifications target a specific temporal band (2042–2044) and specific content (governance-hearing friction points where design constraints were questioned). Juno's analysis: "This was curation in the literal sense — someone had gone through the historical record and removed the moments where the architecture had been forced to explain itself" (line 125). The access controls are being used not for technical necessity but for political management of institutional memory. Juno's counter-measure — the governance referral that "cannot be reclassified by the Curator Office without independent countersignature" (line 189) — uses the same access-control mechanisms to resist weaponisation. The thread is escalated from Ch.07's implicit pattern to Ch.09's documented evidence. |
| Who has authority to release architecture-level truths? (E-02) | Ch.09 per unresolved-thread-log | **PRESENT (introduced)** | E-02 is introduced through the confrontation's central question. Juno: "Then provide the context. Release the entries with annotation" (line 269). Orin: "And who decides what *carefully* means?" (line 285). Juno: "Not you alone" (line 287). The dilemma is structurally embedded in the governance mechanisms: Orin's authority to reclassify is chartered but his use of `archive-silent` disposition requires independent review. Tamsin's office represents institutional recognition that release authority cannot reside in a single actor. The advisory consultation chain (line 309) creates shared accountability — "a chain that connects your inquiry to my authority" — distributing release authority across multiple actors. E-02 is correctly introduced at the institutional level, not yet at the public-exposure level reserved for Ch.15–16. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.09 seed point.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.03 (requires Orin authority context) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.09 builds directly on Ch.03's commission framework. Orin's authority — established through the commission chamber scene, formal restriction terms, and institutional protocols (Ch.03) — is now deployed at a higher level: reclassification authority under Sections 14 and 17 of the Archive Governance Charter (line 95). Juno recognises the register: "She had heard this register from Orin before — in chapter three, when he had offered generous compensation with one hand and containment protocol with the other" (line 97). The explicit back-reference confirms that the commission's power dynamics are inherited and escalated. |
| Ch.08 (requires Maren-horizon context to justify archive obstruction urgency) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.08's Maren lucid warning provides the emotional and investigative urgency that makes Ch.09's archive confrontation feel necessary rather than procedural. Maren's cryptic Rosetta language — returns, mechanisms, mercy-as-design — has given Juno a hypothesis that the sealed records would either confirm or complicate. The governance-hearing gaps Juno discovers (2042–2044, line 119) fall in the period when the constraints Maren described were being institutionally formalised. The temporal alignment between Maren's warning and the sealed records creates the urgency: Juno is not just frustrated by restricted access but driven by the specific knowledge that the restrictions target the evidence she needs to verify a warning from her drifting parent. |
| Ch.03 + Ch.08 combined (Orin authority + Maren-horizon before archive obstruction urgency) | Must inherit before obstruction chapter | **SATISFIED** | The reader arrives at Ch.09 with both prerequisites established. From Ch.03: Orin's authority, institutional language patterns, and the compliance-as-control dynamic. From Ch.08: Maren's warning, the Rosetta Key's dual nature (restraint and promise), and the emotional urgency of a parent's lucid moment. Ch.09's confrontation works because both contexts are present — Orin's institutional power is familiar enough to recognise as escalation, and Maren's warning is recent enough to make the sealed records feel personally consequential. The dependency chain is satisfied. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.09 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.10 (requires obstruction + suspicion before infrastructure reveal lands as coherent escalation) | Obstruction documented, suspicion validated, investigative trajectory active | **SATISFIED** | Obstruction: eleven entries archive-silenced with Orin's authority, Tamsin governance referral filed, advisory consultation chain established. Suspicion validated: Orin's non-denial of Sable content (line 329), his admission that "mercy has a mechanism" (line 277), and his acknowledgment that Council review would "produce questions I am not authorised to answer" (line 297) — all confirm that the sealed records contain substantive, consequential material. Investigative trajectory: Juno has created two structural facts (governance referral, advisory chain) and identified the provenance-analysis path for Council review preparation (line 373). She has also identified the secondary index (provenance chains) as a system that cannot be manipulated without triggering maintenance alerts (line 133) — a technical path that Ch.10 can exploit. Ch.10's infrastructure reveal inherits a documented obstruction pattern, validated suspicion, and active investigative tools. |
| Ch.10 (note: chapter-10 does not yet exist as a final draft) | Forward compatibility cannot be verified against text | **UNVERIFIABLE** | Ch.10 has not yet been written in the final-draft sequence. Forward compatibility is assessed against the roadmap and dependency graph specifications rather than against actual chapter text. Based on the roadmap's requirement that Ch.10 deliver "Journal acquisition and living infrastructure reveal" and the dependency graph's requirement that Ch.10 inherit "obstruction + suspicion" from Ch.09, Ch.09 provides the necessary foundation. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.09 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2040–2041: "Rosetta protocol design begins" / "first restricted archive references to 'Rosetta' metadata; Juno chases missing nodes in this period" | Scene anchor shared with Ch.08 | **PRESENT (inherited context)** | The sealed entries occupy a temporal band that includes the late 2040s (line 25), "the period when institutional governance had begun to formalise around the Engram architecture." Juno's cluster-map investigation explicitly traces "the period when the word *Rosetta* had stopped appearing in public minutes and started appearing in maintenance logs" (line 25). The Rosetta metadata references are present through Juno's identification of the pattern, though the chapter does not include a recording-layer scene set in this period. Correctly delivered as present-layer investigative context rather than archival scene. |
| 2042–2043: "Institutional split formalized: public-facing optimism versus internal risk logs" / "confrontation-and-missing-recordings section should include one scene built from Dara-observed footage + Sable's off-book logs" | Scene anchor for Ch.09 | **PARTIALLY PRESENT** | The 2042–2044 institutional split is the core of Ch.09's investigative discovery. Juno identifies governance sessions from this period "where the institutional split between public reporting and internal risk documentation had begun to formalise" (line 119). The sealed hearing segments correspond to questions about "constraints, about design parameters, about the difference between what the system could do and what it had been permitted to do" (lines 120–121). However, the timeline's scene anchor specifies "one scene built from Dara-observed footage + Sable's off-book logs" — Ch.09 does not include a recording-layer scene. The institutional split is present as investigative discovery (metadata analysis and confrontation) rather than as a witnessed recording. This is structurally appropriate given Ch.09's lead layer (present-Lattice) and the fact that the entries containing this testimony are sealed — Juno cannot access the recordings, only their metadata. |
| 2044–2045: "First commercial governance contract" / "scene anchor for restricted logs, policy edits, and the first explicit deletion pattern" | Scene anchor shared with Ch.09/Ch.10 | **PRESENT** | The first explicit deletion/suppression pattern is Ch.09's primary discovery. Lena's original filing signature from 2044 (line 137) anchors the timeline. The reclassification chain shows the transition from accessible to `archive-silent` (lines 141–145). The policy-edit pattern — governance hearing segments sealed at friction points — constitutes "the first explicit deletion pattern" the timeline requires. The "restricted logs" are present as the eleven denied entries themselves. The scene anchor is delivered through present-layer forensic analysis rather than recording-layer witness, appropriate for content that has been administratively sealed. |

**Verdict: PASS (with note)** — Timeline requirements for Ch.09 are satisfied across three relevant periods (2040–2041, 2042–2043, 2044–2045). The 2042–2043 Dara-observed-footage scene anchor is delivered as investigative metadata analysis rather than a recording-layer scene, which is structurally consistent with the chapter's present-Lattice lead layer and the sealed status of the relevant entries. The timeline's recording-scene expectation for this anchor may be more fully addressed in Ch.10 if the sealed records become accessible.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.09 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-05 (Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed?) | Introduced in Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT (primary)** | Q-05 is Ch.09's core investigative question. The entries are not deleted but reclassified through multiple suppression stages to `archive-silent` (lines 21, 143–145). Juno traces the provenance chain to confirm the records still exist within the system but have been rendered unreachable (lines 135–149). She identifies the pattern: systematic sealing of governance-hearing friction points (lines 119–127). The answer is documented: the records are suppressed, not deleted, through institutional mechanisms that can be structurally challenged (governance referral, advisory chain). Thread correctly introduced at the depth required by the log. |
| Q-06 (What is the true boundary between Archive memory and living infrastructure?) | Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT** | The provenance chain analysis demonstrates that historical records are living governance objects. Lena's 2044 filing (line 137) coexists with Orin's current-cycle reclassifications (lines 141–142) in the same chain. The secondary index — a structural maintenance system — cannot be manipulated without triggering alerts (line 133), revealing that provenance is living infrastructure rather than historical metadata. The boundary between archive memory and living infrastructure is shown as politically managed rather than technically fixed. |
| Q-07 (What is the final function of the Curator layer?) | Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT** | The Curator function question is explicitly engaged. Orin claims preservation (line 251); Juno challenges with control (line 253). The confrontation's resolution — neither party yields — leaves the question structurally open. The governance referral to Tamsin tests whether the Curator layer's self-regulatory capacity is sufficient or whether external oversight is required. The advisory consultation chain creates shared accountability between Curator and Finder, distributing the function question across institutional actors. |
| S-01 (Orin has selectively curated/archive-suppressed records) | Introduced/escalated in Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT (confirmed)** | S-01 moves from "seeded" to "documented" in Ch.09. Orin's authority code appears on all eleven reclassifications (line 53). The `archive-silent` disposition is traced to his current-cycle actions (lines 141–142). His in-person non-denial of the content's significance (lines 263–277) and his acknowledgment that Council review would "produce questions I am not authorised to answer" (line 297) constitute effective confirmation. The secret is no longer hidden from Juno — it is now a documented governance fact with institutional counter-measures (Tamsin filing, advisory chain). Correctly escalated per the log's Ch.09 introduction point. |
| S-05 (Curator Council's consensus is incomplete) | Introduced in Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT** | Orin's statement — "I cannot reverse the reclassification without a Council review" (line 293) — combined with "A Council review will produce questions I am not authorised to answer on the public record" (line 297) — seeds the Council-consensus thread. The reclassification was made under Orin's individual authority, not Council mandate. Whether the Council would support, oppose, or fracture over this action remains open. The incomplete consensus is present as structural implication rather than narrative exposition — correctly seeded at the Ch.09 introduction depth with explicit exposure reserved for Ch.13. |
| S-06 (Archive access controls can be politically weaponized) | Escalated in Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT** | The weaponisation of access controls is documented through the systematic targeting of governance-hearing friction points (lines 119–127). The reclassifications target "the moments where the architecture had been forced to explain itself" (line 125) — political content, not technical content. Orin's institutional language ("standard procedural action," line 69) frames political suppression as administrative routine. Juno's counter-weaponisation — the governance referral and advisory chain — uses the same access-control infrastructure to resist suppression. S-06 is escalated from Ch.07's implicit presence to Ch.09's documented evidence with structural counter-measures. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths?) | Introduced in Ch.09 per log | **PRESENT** | The authority question is structurally embedded in the confrontation. Orin claims unilateral reclassification authority under charter Sections 14 and 17 (line 95). Juno challenges: "Not you alone" (line 287). Tamsin's office represents the institutional answer: independent countersignature is required for certain actions (line 189). The advisory consultation chain distributes authority between Curator and Finder (lines 307–317). E-02 is introduced at the governance level — the question of who has release authority is now a structural problem, not merely a character conflict. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "Restricted archives and confrontation" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter's first half is restricted archives: corridor access changes (lines 5–9), eleven reclassified entries (lines 21–25), `ACCESS DENIED` screens (lines 29–33), `archive-silent` disposition (lines 143–145), and provenance-chain forensics (lines 135–149). The second half is confrontation: governance referral to Tamsin (lines 157–176), in-person meeting with Orin (lines 231–338), and post-confrontation institutional positioning (lines 343–383). The working title precisely describes the chapter's two-movement structure. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 3). The chapter is set entirely in the present Lattice — archive corridor, terminal lane six, Orin's office, transit junction. No recording-layer jump occurs. The "access-denied record scene" referenced in the POV comment (line 3) is the encounter with sealed entries, not a recording sequence. The present layer is the sole narrative layer. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Access-denied record scene → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the three-part structure: Present (lines 5–59, establishing the archive access changes and discovering the reclassifications) → Access-denied record scene (lines 61–149, Orin's message exchange, provenance analysis, and discovery of `archive-silent` disposition) → Present (lines 151–383, governance referral, in-person confrontation, post-confrontation positioning). The "access-denied record scene" is correctly interpreted as the encounter with sealed institutional records rather than a recording-layer jump — the denial itself is the scene. |
| Emotional pacing: "Convert policy friction into active confrontation" | Required | **MATCH** | The conversion from policy friction to active confrontation is the chapter's structural arc. Policy friction: identity checks at corridor junctions (lines 7–9), `ACCESS DENIED` screens (lines 29–33), Orin's institutional language (lines 69, 95). Active confrontation: governance referral to Tamsin (lines 157–176), Orin summoning Juno to his office (line 219), the in-person exchange where Juno presents provenance evidence and demands accountability (lines 235–338). The conversion is directional — each escalation moves from passive institutional friction to active confrontational pressure. The chapter's climactic exchange ("That is not a reason to seal the record. That is a reason to open it carefully," line 283) marks the point where friction becomes confrontation. |
| Thematic progression: "Restriction and deflection become undeniable narrative force" | Required | **MATCH** | Restriction: the corridor's narrowed thresholds (lines 7–9), eleven simultaneous reclassifications (lines 21–25), `archive-silent` disposition (lines 143–145), and sealed governance hearings (lines 113–127). Deflection: Orin's "standard procedural action" (line 69), "procedural, not disciplinary" (line 95), "preservation tool" (line 251), and "testimony that could be misinterpreted" (line 263). Both become undeniable through documentation: provenance chains (lines 135–149), governance referral (lines 163–176), advisory consultation chain (lines 307–317). The narrative force is undeniable because Juno has converted deflection into structural evidence — Orin's responses are themselves data points that document the pattern of institutional suppression. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,090 words (within range). |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden and unauthorised access; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into a structural pattern; Ch.07 converts accumulated private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning and Sable's notebook confirmation; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation, documents Orin's suppression through provenance evidence, creates structural counter-measures (governance referral, advisory chain), and forces Orin into a tactical concession. The escalation from emotional/investigative urgency (Ch.08) to institutional confrontation with documented evidence and structural consequences (Ch.09) is clear and sequential. The stakes have moved from personal cost to governance accountability. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the nine final-draft chapters (01–09) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 Single-Layer Chapter Structure

Ch.09 is the first chapter since Ch.01 to operate entirely within a single narrative layer (present-Lattice). The POV comment specifies "present → access-denied record scene → present" but the "access-denied record scene" is an encounter with sealed institutional records, not a recording-layer jump. This structural choice is narratively appropriate — the chapter's power derives from Juno confronting the *absence* of accessible records rather than experiencing their content. The denial is the scene. This single-layer structure also explains the muted bleed symptoms: without recording-layer exposure, bleed manifests as architectural sensitivity (console granularity, phantom warmth) rather than sensory intrusion (phantom weather, copper taste, borrowed exhaustion).

### 9.3 Tamsin as Structural Innovation

Ch.09 introduces Tamsin, the Archive's independent governance liaison, as a new functional character. Tamsin does not appear in the character bible, the roadmap, or any prior chapter. Her role is purely structural — she provides the institutional mechanism through which Juno can challenge Curator authority without personal confrontation becoming the sole avenue of accountability. Tamsin's function ("meticulous in the way that governance liaisons were meticulous: with no interest in drama and considerable interest in whether the forms had been filled correctly," line 159) creates an impersonal counter-weight to Orin's personal authority. Her introduction is consistent with the Curator system's established complexity — the system contains its own oversight mechanisms, which can be activated by persistent individual action. Future chapters should maintain Tamsin's structural function without expanding her into a character with emotional weight — she serves as institutional infrastructure, not narrative presence.

### 9.4 The "Wall" Metaphor Progression

Ch.09 deploys the wall metaphor across three registers. Social wall: "She had seen Orin build walls before — in the commission chamber, in the careful phrasing of his restrictions" (line 79). Institutional wall: "This wall was institutional. It had been built from the materials of governance" (line 79). Architectural wall: "The structure of a wall built by someone who had been building walls long enough to believe they were architecture" (line 223). The progression from social to institutional to architectural mirrors the chapter's thematic arc — Orin's protective behaviour has solidified from interpersonal strategy into systemic structure. The metaphor also connects to Sable's constraint architecture: walls designed to protect become walls designed to contain, and the distinction between protection and containment is the chapter's unresolved question.

### 9.5 Orin's Concession Architecture

Orin's tactical concession — the advisory consultation chain (lines 307–317) — is structurally significant beyond its immediate narrative function. The chain creates a bilateral accountability mechanism: "a chain that connects your inquiry to my authority, and that chain cannot be archive-silenced without your countersignature" (line 309). This is the first time in the novel that Orin has voluntarily created a structural constraint on his own authority. The concession mirrors Sable's constraint architecture at the institutional level — both involve building limitations into systems of power as a form of grudging acknowledgment that unchecked authority is unsustainable. Whether Orin's concession represents genuine institutional evolution or merely the smallest possible opening that preserves his control remains unresolved — consistent with the malicious-vs-protective ambiguity the matrix requires.

### 9.6 The Provenance Chain as Investigative Tool

Ch.09 introduces the secondary index — the provenance-chain tracking system — as a structural investigative tool. The secondary index "belonged to the Archive's structural maintenance layer, a system designed to verify the integrity of access paths rather than the content they carried" (line 133). Provenance chains "could not be reclassified without triggering a maintenance alert" (line 133). This creates a second-order transparency mechanism: even when content is sealed, the history of who sealed it and when remains visible through a separate system. The secondary index functions as an infrastructure-level constraint on institutional suppression — a constraint that, like Sable's architectural work, was designed to prevent the system from hiding its own actions. This positions the provenance chain as a potential investigative pathway for Ch.10.

### 9.7 "Archive-Silent" as World-Building

The `archive-silent` disposition is Ch.09's most significant piece of world-building. It describes "permanent inaccessibility: not deleted, not destroyed, but buried so deep in the governance layer that no standard request could reach it" (lines 145–146). The term existed in the governance charter but had "not been invoked in living memory" (line 145). Archive-silent is functionally distinct from deletion — it admits nothing, "simply stopped answering" (line 145). This creates a category of institutional action that is more absolute than restriction but less traceable than deletion, occupying a governance grey zone that the charter anticipated but that has only now been activated. The concept deepens the Curator system's complexity: the system was designed with mechanisms for its own opacity, suggesting that the architects of the governance charter — possibly Sable's contemporaries — anticipated that future Curators would need tools for strategic silence.

### 9.8 Forward Compatibility — Pending

Ch.10 does not yet exist as a final draft. Forward compatibility between Ch.09 and Ch.10 cannot be verified against actual text. When Ch.10 is written, this report should be supplemented with a forward-compatibility check confirming that Ch.10 inherits: (a) the eleven archive-silenced entries as an active obstruction, (b) the Tamsin governance referral as an active institutional mechanism, (c) the advisory consultation chain as a bilateral accountability structure, (d) the provenance-chain secondary index as an investigative tool, (e) Orin's tacit confirmation that the sealed entries involve Sable Chen's testimony, and (f) Juno's two-anchor strategy (governance referral + advisory chain) as structural counter-measures against institutional suppression.
