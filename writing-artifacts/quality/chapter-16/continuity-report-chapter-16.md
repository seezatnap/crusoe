## 0. Automated-Tool Audit

The Rust `continuity-check` binary was run against `final-draft-chapters/chapter-16.md`.

```
$ cargo run --package continuity-check -- final-draft-chapters/chapter-16.md
No continuity violations.
```

**Finding:** The tool reported 0 violations because the chapter contains **zero** `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. The tool's scene parser found nothing to validate. The "0 violations" result is **vacuously true** — no scenes were parsed, so no checks were performed.

This report provides the manual cross-reference that the automated tool could not perform.

## 1. Reveal Matrix Compliance (§2 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### Chapter 16 Required Reveals

| Required reveal content | Status | Evidence in chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Public exposure, resistance, and coalition dynamics with Cassiel/Fen | **PRESENT** | Ch.16 delivers all three elements across its full arc. **Public exposure:** The chapter opens twelve hours after the Ch.15 hearing with 1,128 citizen submissions already recorded (line 7). The disclosure is no longer an institutional event but a civic one — citizens query from residential blocks, education rings, dock maintenance, and anonymous channels (lines 9–27). By the chapter's close, 8,413 submissions have been logged (line 485) and three thousand translation nodes are active in residential corridors, market lanes, and clinic vestibules (line 521). **Resistance:** Institutional resistance arrives as district channels switching to `hold` status (line 139), a Curator refusal packet from district-17 stewardship council (lines 141–149), Orin's pre-composed cautionary notice (lines 155–158), compliance flags on volunteer channels (line 291), and the coordinated legal phrase `liability statement withheld while public interpretation incomplete` (line 347). The resistance escalates from procedural delay through active rerouting attempts to formal legal obstructionism. **Coalition dynamics:** Fen builds direct neighbourhood relay infrastructure bypassing the Curator distribution layer (lines 41–51), Cassiel runs plain-language sessions in district arts networks (lines 109–131) and prepares three hundred neighbourhood session outlines (line 115), Lien intervenes publicly to reframe Orin's cautionary notice as advisory rather than prohibition (lines 161–168), and Juno coordinates the overall translation and response effort. The coalition operates through practical infrastructure — routing panels, relay strips, chalk maps, translation packets — rather than political declarations. |
| Reveal status: "Public (political)" | **CONSISTENT** | The chapter converts Ch.15's public-strategic disclosure into political reality. The political dimension manifests in three registers: (a) institutional contestation — district stewardship councils issue advisories restricting public simulations, raw packets, and citizen translation posts (line 177), attempting to reclaim interpretive authority over the disclosure material; (b) civic participation — citizens move from passive receipt to active engagement, asking practical questions about constraint modification, walking to projection squares, opening feed mirrors, translating documentation into community idioms (lines 59–103); (c) governance negotiation — the late forum in the tram-tunnel relay space (lines 385–447) produces a hybrid outcome where Orin writes witness-protocol language expanding review to "moral burden, not only technical harm" (line 413) while the Curator authority files a formal notation of "no enforcement pending active witness review" (line 481). The reveal is political because the truth is no longer being disclosed but contested — who controls its interpretation, distribution, and consequences is the chapter's central question. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All required reveal content for Ch.16 is present at the correct reveal status (public / political). The chapter converts private revelation into social event with irreversible consequences as the matrix specifies.

## 2. Character Arc Continuity (§1 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 2.1 Juno Alcázar-Reed

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| She resolves the epistemic burden by exposing design truth without collapsing the polity, and chooses a constrained-but-transparent path instead of suppression or dissolution | **PRESENT (advanced — political implementation phase)** | Ch.16 advances Juno's Act 4 resolution from Ch.15's public hearing into political implementation. She responds to the first citizen queries by hand, dismissing the system's standardised triage prompts: "She dismissed them and typed her first response by hand" (line 29). Her response to the residential block 9-east query names Sable Chen directly, provides her death date, and directs citizens to the disclosure packet (line 31) — converting the hearing's institutional disclosure into individual-level communication. She places Orin's private forum request on the public channel before responding (lines 205–209), refusing to allow the institutional confrontation to retreat from public view. Her closing proposal addendum (lines 455–465) operationalises the constrained-but-transparent path: public oversight panel with mixed delegates, reversible simulation windows, no pressure for constraint modification, publicly visible grief support and rollback. The polity has not collapsed — 8,413 submissions demonstrate civic engagement, not crisis — and the constrained-but-transparent path is being built through infrastructure (relay nodes, translation packets, witness signatures) rather than proclamation. |
| Obsession resolved into responsibility | **CONSISTENT** | Juno's obsession — which progressed from curiosity (Ch.01) through fixation (Ch.04) through rogue access (Ch.11) through institutional defiance (Ch.13) through lineage inheritance (Ch.14) through public triage (Ch.15) — is fully operational in Ch.16 as civic responsibility. She reads each citizen entry individually (line 29). She does not delegate interpretation to standardised systems. She holds the argument with Orin long enough for the record to capture it (line 289). She sends Maren the three-word status — `public burden accepted` (line 513) — naming the transformation explicitly: the epistemic burden has become a public obligation, not a private fixation. Her closing action is not personal vindication but institutional: she sets the relay to broadcast phase-two instructions (lines 525–537), establishing the next operational cycle. The obsession is no longer present; what remains is the working rhythm of a person who understands that the truth she pursued is now the city's to hold. |
| Risk: obsession resolved too cleanly | **NO VIOLATION** | The resolution is not clean. Juno does not celebrate or claim victory: "She did not call it a victory" (line 511). Her honest morning is not triumph — "She did not mistake the silence for resolution. She recognised it as the quiet of a room where the argument had moved from whether to speak to what to say" (line 553). The resistance she encounters — district channel holds, compliance flags, legal obstructionism — demonstrates that the disclosure has generated genuine political contestation, not consensus. Maren's response — "and now no one can carry it for you" (line 517) — explicitly denies the comfort of shared burden: the weight is not lighter because others share it, only bearable. Fen's observation that her face shows "relieved and furious at the same time" (line 497) captures the emotional complexity: the disclosure is both necessary and costly, and the cost has not been paid. |

### 2.2 Orin Thalassa

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Faces public and moral costs of long-term custodial deception but is not demonized as purely villainous | **PRESENT** | Orin is Ch.16's most complex institutional figure, operating across four registers. **Institutional authority:** his pre-composed cautionary notice (lines 155–158) is released at a pre-determined threshold, demonstrating strategic institutional positioning — he anticipated the disclosure's trajectory and prepared containment language in advance. **Personal engagement:** he requests a private forum with Juno (lines 197–203) but accepts her transformation of it into a public event (lines 205–213). He arrives at the late tram-tunnel forum "without council seal or escort" (line 389), presenting himself as a person rather than an office. **Moral complexity:** his argument is not suppression but pacing — "I am not asking a city to become fearless. I am saying we do not run faster than the institutions that hold us can follow" (line 421). His caution about disclosure becoming coercion — "If someone chooses a high-risk modification and is harmed, this room carries the responsibility" (line 421) — raises a legitimate governance concern. **Ethical evolution:** he takes Juno's pen and writes witness-protocol language including "moral burden, not only technical harm" (line 413), expanding the review framework beyond his original position. His closing status — `present — no enforcement action pending` (line 475) — captures a man who has not accepted the new order but has chosen to remain visible within it. He is neither villain nor convert but an institutional actor whose authority is being publicly renegotiated. |
| No overexposure of intentions — moral ambiguity preserved | **CONSISTENT** | Orin's intentions remain layered throughout Ch.16. His cautionary notice is simultaneously protective ("cascading risk," line 157) and self-preserving (maintaining Curator interpretive authority). His forum argument is simultaneously principled ("The current architecture was built because we could not afford unbounded minds in a fractured substrate," line 229) and positional (maintaining institutional control over the pace of change). His witness-protocol addition ("moral burden, not only technical harm") is simultaneously an expansion of the review framework and a positioning manoeuvre — by including moral burden, he claims a role in defining the terms of accountability. His final status (`present — no enforcement action pending`) is simultaneously restraint and strategic patience. The chapter preserves the core ambiguity: Orin is a person whose protective instincts and institutional self-interest are genuinely difficult to separate, and the difficulty is the point. |

### 2.3 Maren Alcázar

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Serves as final emotional referendum on whether truth can be held without breaking relational love | **PRESENT (advanced through two message exchanges)** | Maren appears in Ch.16 through two message exchanges that bookend the chapter's political action. **First exchange** (lines 67–83): her message arrives in "the fragmented cadence that Maren's drift imposed on every communication" (line 71), delivering four lines of counsel: "if you let them call this clarity now / they will ask for certainty by noon / offer the city a ritual of caution not a declaration / someone must remind everyone what caution costs" (lines 73–79). This is not abstract wisdom but tactical guidance — Maren understands institutional dynamics from centuries of experience and provides the strategic framing Juno needs. Juno places the message at the top of her working file (line 83), treating Maren's counsel as operational intelligence. **Second exchange** (lines 511–519): Juno sends `public burden accepted` (line 513), naming the transformation from private investigation to civic responsibility. Maren's reply — "and now no one can carry it for you" (line 517) — completes the emotional referendum: truth has not broken the relational bond but has transformed its terms. Maren no longer carries the secret alone (Ch.14's lineage transfer), but the burden of public disclosure cannot be shared or delegated — it belongs to the person who chose it. The relational love persists through the act of communication itself: Maren spends her diminishing lucidity on words that are simultaneously tender and unsparing. |
| Drift progression consistent | **CONSISTENT** | Maren's drift is visible in both message exchanges. The first message arrives in "fragmented cadence" (line 71), with each sentence described as "a small act of concentration, each pause the cost of a mind gathering itself long enough to speak" (line 71). The second reply "arrived through delay — through the slowness of a mind gathering itself to speak" (line 515). The progression from Ch.14's extended four-register confession through Ch.15's compressed three-line message to Ch.16's two exchanges (four-line counsel and one-line response) is consistent: each appearance costs more and delivers less in volume, but the remaining lucidity is spent on communications of increasing precision. Maren's tactical awareness in the first message — understanding institutional dynamics and civic psychology — demonstrates that drift has not destroyed her analytical capacity, only compressed the window in which she can deploy it. |

### 2.4 Cassiel Vey

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps convert revelation into a communal practice of living with uncertainty | **PRESENT** | Cassiel appears in four structural positions in Ch.16, each advancing the conversion from revelation to communal practice. **Plain-language sessions** (lines 109–131): he has been running sessions in district arts networks since dawn, preparing three hundred neighbourhood session outlines. His work is translation — converting the constraint documentation into language communities can use. **Chalk map witness** (lines 311–339): he pulls Juno to a square where students have built a witness-signature installation using chalk patterns and light projections. He reads the students' questions aloud and articulates the chapter's central insight: "They are not asking whether the architecture is dangerous. They are asking whether the architecture belongs to them. We cannot answer that with a policy framework. We answer it by being present and by doing the work" (line 323). **Ethical formulation** (lines 337–339): he provides the sentence Juno will use: "we are not promising the city safety. We are promising the city that safety will no longer be decided without the city in the room." **Late forum partnership** (lines 417, 501–509): in the tram-tunnel forum, he reframes Orin's partial witness as "not refusal. That is the beginning of the same sentence" (line 417), converting institutional hesitation into collaborative entry. His closing observation — "no one thought it was clean, and still they came" (line 509) — names the communal practice: not consensus or certainty but continued presence despite imperfection. |
| Risk: Keep acceptance arc paced and earned | **NO VIOLATION** | Cassiel's Ch.16 engagement is the culmination of a correctly paced five-chapter progression: re-entry with distance (Ch.07), private ethical counsel (Ch.13), formal witness commitment (Ch.14), public hearing partnership (Ch.15), and communal translation leadership (Ch.16). His contribution in Ch.16 is operational rather than declarative — he runs sessions, prepares materials, reads students' questions, provides language Juno can use. The relationship with Juno is expressed through shared labour rather than emotional reconciliation: he "appeared at her shoulder" (line 501) with session materials, not with personal words. The arc is paced: Cassiel's partnership operates through ethical co-presence and practical translation, not yet through emotional resolution, which is correctly reserved for Ch.17. |

### 2.5 Fen Maro

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Helps stabilize outcomes at the social edge of public exposure and aftermath | **PRESENT** | Fen is Ch.16's primary infrastructure architect, stabilising the social edge through five structural interventions. **Routing bypass** (lines 37–51): he identifies the Curator distribution layer as a bottleneck — "three of four district relays still operating under Orin's cautionary advisory" (line 41) — and builds direct neighbourhood feeds using old technical shorthand invisible to automated compliance monitors (line 47). **Translation packets** (lines 89–103): his first public translation packet (`what is at risk now`) generates 216 responses in twenty minutes and is mirrored by 43 local relay points in seven minutes. **Institutional counter-analysis** (lines 151, 177–179): he sorts institutional responses from citizen complaints, identifying the strategy — "If they control what counts as authorised interpretation, the original documentation becomes inaccessible outside the governance tier" (line 179). **Maintenance-level routing** (lines 183–189, 301–305): he connects portable relays to protocol layers the compliance systems do not monitor, routing disclosure into neighbourhoods, schools, and community clinics. **Phrase dismantlement** (lines 351–357): he translates the Curator legal phrase into neighbourhood language, converting institutional obstructionism into civic clarity. By 01:00, five thousand translation packets have been distributed (line 359). Fen's stabilising role operates through infrastructure construction and institutional translation, consistent with his established pattern as the practical-operational member of the coalition. |
| Risk: concern too abrupt | **NO VIOLATION** | Fen's concern in Ch.16 is expressed through competent, sustained infrastructure work. He arrives carrying relay panels and tea (line 35) with "the economy of someone who had already calculated the next four hours" (line 35). His observations are analytical: "They are trying to own the emergency language" (line 179). His emotional register is controlled: his exhale when Juno acknowledges the translation-layer counter-strategy "was not quite laughter" (line 299). His final observation about Juno's face being "relieved and furious at the same time" (line 497) is characteristically precise and personal without being sentimental. The alliance is fully operational: he has transitioned from Ch.15's social-edge observation to Ch.16's infrastructure leadership without any abruptness. |

### 2.6 Lien (Retired Steward)

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Functions as institutional memory bridge | **PRESENT (advanced through public intervention and late-night counsel)** | Lien appears in three structural positions in Ch.16. **Public reframing** (lines 161–168): he intervenes on the public channel to challenge Orin's cautionary notice — "If you issue caution as a wall, the city hears *stay away*. If you issue caution as a warning, it hears *watch with me*. Choose your verbs" (line 163). This intervention converts Orin's institutional language into a choice between exclusion and invitation, and Fen routes Lien's statement to the full neighbourhood register (line 165). **Late-night counsel** (lines 361–379): he arrives at the relay station without invitation, reads the room with "the gesture of a person reading a map" (line 367), identifies the structural change — "There is no single office to hold accountable now" (line 369) — and provides tactical assessment: "They can [force a rollback]. But if they do, they will have to do it in public" (line 379). His observation about Juno's "one mistake and one right call" (line 375) demonstrates the institutional-memory perspective: he can distinguish between strategic errors (personal channel visibility) and strategic successes (institutional channel honesty) because he has served in governance long enough to understand how public perception operates. **Witness presence** (line 547): he signs the witness register (line 441) and maintains presence-in-absence from home, because "presence, he had said, was the only currency that could not be forged" (line 547). Lien's bridge function operates across three institutional eras: the transition era he remembers personally (Ch.15's "someone I once knew"), the stewardship era he served in, and the disclosure era Ch.16 inaugurates. |

### 2.7 Sable Chen

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core design ethics become emotionally legible and no longer only plot mechanism | **PRESENT (advanced through public-facing naming)** | Sable appears in Ch.16 through two registers of reference. **Direct naming** (line 31): Juno's first citizen response names Sable publicly — "the designer's name was Sable Chen. She died in 2071. Her notes are now public." This is the first time Sable is named directly to an ordinary citizen outside the hearing context, converting the architect from institutional evidence into a person with a name and a death date. **Through students' questions** (lines 311–319): the witness-signature installation built by students demonstrates that the constraint documentation — Sable's work — has been read and processed by young people who respond with personal questions ("if the guardrails changed, who stays with me?" line 313). Juno's interpretation of the students' response captures the emotional legibility of Sable's design ethics: "the quality of a person encountering the architecture of their own experience and discovering it was built by someone who was frightened, and who had loved them enough to be frightened on their behalf, and who had not trusted them enough to explain" (line 319). Sable's design ethics have moved beyond plot mechanism and doctrinal exposition into lived civic experience. |
| Ensure complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension) | **NO VIOLATION** | Sable's dual nature is preserved in Ch.16 through the students' reception of the constraint documentation. The questions the students write — about guardrail changes, about asking for help, about refusing to sign the witness register (lines 313–317) — demonstrate that the public is processing the constraints as both protection (guardrails that keep people stable) and limitation (structures imposed without consent). Juno's reading of their response explicitly maintains the tension: Sable "had loved them enough to be frightened on their behalf" (protector) "and had not trusted them enough to explain" (limiter). The complexity is not resolved by Ch.16's civic process — it is distributed to the population, who must now hold the tension individually and collectively. |

### 2.8 Marcus Fell

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Can become a late-stage foil or silent beneficiary of institutional continuity | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (inherited through institutional resistance dynamics)** | Marcus does not appear by name in Ch.16. His presence is inherited through the institutional resistance that constitutes the chapter's primary antagonist force. The district stewardship councils' advisories — "no public simulations without preclearance, no raw packets outside approved modules, no citizen translation posts without provenance stamps" (line 177) — use the same access-control logic Marcus championed during the design era. Orin's argument that "The current architecture was built because we could not afford unbounded minds in a fractured substrate" (line 229) inherits Marcus's technical-rationalization position: system continuity over moral warning. The Curator authority's legal phrase — `liability statement withheld while public interpretation incomplete` (line 347) — is the administrative descendant of Marcus's institutional philosophy: delay truth until the institution has controlled the framing. Marcus's absence is consistent with his matrix position as "silent beneficiary of institutional continuity" — the institutional reflexes that resist disclosure are the structural descendants of the pragmatic-suppression pole he represented. |

### 2.9 Curator System

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Legitimacy is re-negotiated publicly; truth release challenge reframes Curator authority | **PRESENT (advanced through political contestation)** | The Curator system's legitimacy is publicly contested in Ch.16 through five mechanisms. **First — distribution control:** three of four district relays continue operating under Orin's cautionary advisory (line 41), and the compliance systems attempt to contain the disclosure within governance-approved channels. **Second — institutional resistance:** district stewardship councils issue advisories restricting public interpretation (line 177), and compliance flags are applied to volunteer channels (line 291). **Third — legal obstructionism:** the coordinated phrase `liability statement withheld while public interpretation incomplete` (line 347) is the institutional attempt to slow interpretation until urgency fades. **Fourth — public challenge:** Lien's reframing (line 163), Fen's routing bypass (lines 183–189), and the citizen woman's testimony about being "archived into this continuity process at fourteen" (line 279) collectively demonstrate that Curator authority can no longer operate without public scrutiny. **Fifth — partial accommodation:** the Curator authority's formal notation — "no enforcement pending active witness review" (line 481) — represents neither approval nor resistance but a pragmatic recognition that enforcement would have to occur in public. The re-negotiation has progressed from Ch.15's hearing-level disclosure to Ch.16's civic-level contestation, with the Curator system adapting through administrative delay rather than direct suppression. |
| Risk: shifting to omnipotent villainy too quickly | **NO VIOLATION** | The Curator system's enforcement is proportionate and procedural throughout Ch.16. District channels switch to `hold` status (line 139) — a procedural action, not a shutdown. Orin's cautionary notice is a "formal request for restraint" (line 159), not a command. Compliance flags are applied to volunteer channels (line 291) — bureaucratic friction, not censorship. The legal phrase (line 347) is institutional positioning, not enforcement. The Curator system is shown as a governance apparatus adapting to public pressure through administrative tools it has always possessed — delay, classification, compliance requirements — rather than through new coercive measures. The system's final notation ("no enforcement pending active witness review," line 481) demonstrates institutional restraint: the Curator system has the authority to enforce but chooses not to, because enforcement in public would cost more than accommodation. The portrayal preserves the Curator system as a governance structure with legitimate concerns about pacing and risk, not an omnipotent villain. |

### 2.10 Faded/Drifted Legacy

| Matrix requirement (Act 4) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Marks the moral center of why transparency and consent, not fear, must drive Act 4 resolution | **PRESENT (through multiple registers)** | The Faded/drifted legacy operates in Ch.16 through three registers. **Maren's drift-limited counsel:** her two messages (lines 67–83, 515–517) demonstrate the ongoing cost of living within the constraint architecture — each communication is "a small act of concentration" (line 71), each pause a cognitive expenditure. Her counsel is both strategic and embodied: she understands institutional dynamics because she has lived inside the architecture long enough to know its rhythms, and her drift-limited delivery is itself evidence of what the architecture does to the people it contains. **Citizen query context:** the dock maintenance worker asking "where do I apply for a deeper drift audit" (line 23) and the grief coordinator asking about updated support protocols (line 63) demonstrate that drift-affected populations are engaging with the disclosure material, not being protected from it. **Juno's framing of students' response** (line 319): her description of the architecture as "built by someone who was frightened, and who had loved them enough to be frightened on their behalf, and who had not trusted them enough to explain" positions the Faded — the people living inside the constraints — as the population whose right to know has been violated not by malice but by well-intentioned paternalism. The moral center is articulated through the chapter's central theme: transparency is not the absence of fear but the refusal to let fear substitute for consent. |

**Verdict: PASS** — All character arcs for Ch.16 match their matrix-specified Act 4 positions. Juno advances public resolution through civic infrastructure. Orin faces moral costs without demonization and participates in the witness protocol. Cassiel converts revelation into communal practice through translation work. Fen stabilises the social edge through routing infrastructure. Maren's drift progression is consistent. Sable's design ethics become emotionally legible through public-facing naming and students' reception. The Curator system's legitimacy is re-negotiated through political contestation. No premature closure, no missing character beats.

## 3. Unresolved-Thread Matrix Compliance (§3 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

| Thread | Ch.16 requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Carried forward per matrix; final impact tested in Ch.17 | **PRESENT (carried forward through two message exchanges)** | Maren's fear of the Key — partially closed through Ch.14's confession and carried forward through Ch.15's three-line message — is advanced in Ch.16 through her tactical counsel. Her first message (lines 73–79) demonstrates that her fear was not only emotional but strategic: she understands how institutional dynamics convert disclosure into bureaucratic capture ("if you let them call this clarity now / they will ask for certainty by noon"). Her fear of the Key was a fear of institutional cycles — the same patterns of control and suppression that she watched unfold during the design era. Her second message — "and now no one can carry it for you" (line 517) — positions the burden as non-transferable: Maren's fear was justified not because the Key was dangerous but because the responsibility of disclosing it could not be shared or delegated. The thread is correctly carried forward without premature closure: Maren's fear is explained (Ch.14), its strategic wisdom is deployed (Ch.15–16), and the final emotional impact on the Juno-Maren relationship is reserved for Ch.17. |
| Whether Orin's suppression is malicious or protective | Mostly resolved Ch.13–14 per matrix | **PRESENT (further resolved through public political action)** | The Orin-suppression thread reaches its political resolution in Ch.16. His pre-composed cautionary notice (lines 155–158) demonstrates institutional reflexes that are simultaneously protective and controlling — the same ambiguity the matrix requires. His forum argument (lines 217–229) articulates the protective rationale: unconstrained minds in a fractured substrate led to dissolution and convergence, and institutional caution is not malice but risk management. His pen-taking gesture (lines 411–415) — writing witness-protocol language including "moral burden, not only technical harm" — demonstrates that his suppression was protective in intent but limited in imagination: he is now expanding the framework beyond his original position because public deliberation has surfaced dimensions he did not consider. His final status (`present — no enforcement action pending`, line 475) completes the Ch.16 resolution: Orin's suppression was neither purely malicious nor purely protective but institutionally entrenched — a position that public accountability is now converting from policy to choice. Final moral accounting is correctly preserved for Ch.17. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Open through Ch.15, Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through civic governance framework)** | The Key-removal question is addressed in Ch.16 through the practical implementation of Ch.15's governance framework. The proposal addendum (lines 455–465) specifies: "phase-1 simulation windows remain reversible for 72 cycles" (line 459), "no citizen may be pressured into constraint modification" (line 461), and "if this fails, rollback is immediate and attributable" (line 465). The citizen queries throughout the chapter — particularly the dock maintenance worker's request for "a deeper drift audit" (line 23) and the legacy infrastructure engineer requesting maintenance logs (line 63) — demonstrate that the Key-modification question is being converted from institutional decision into distributed civic process. The thread has progressed from Ch.15's three-option governance framework to Ch.16's implementation: the Key can be modified through witnessed, reversible, publicly visible processes with grief support and rollback provisions. Full resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| Full meaning of Sable's "constraints" | Core meaning resolved as moral/structural paradox in Ch.17 per matrix | **PRESENT (publicly distributed)** | The full meaning of Sable's constraints is distributed to the public in Ch.16 through multiple channels. Juno's direct naming of Sable to a citizen (line 31) makes the architect's identity public knowledge. The constraint documentation is being read in projection squares, private spaces, and civic channels (lines 59–61). The students' witness-signature installation (lines 311–319) demonstrates that the constraints' meaning has reached the population who lives inside them: young people asking "if the guardrails changed, who stays with me?" (line 313) understand the constraints simultaneously as protection and limitation. Juno's interpretation (line 319) articulates the moral/structural paradox: Sable's constraints were built from love and fear simultaneously, and neither dimension resolves the other. The thread has progressed from Ch.15's public articulation to Ch.16's civic distribution: the constraints' meaning is no longer held by investigators, institutions, or hearing audiences but by a city. Core moral resolution is correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| Stability of Juno's identity under sustained stress | Continues as ongoing character condition per matrix | **PRESENT (continued at political-implementation level)** | Juno's identity stability is maintained under the sustained stress of political implementation. She works from 03:18 (line 5) through the next dawn (line 539), managing citizen queries, coordinating infrastructure with Fen, navigating institutional resistance, holding public forums, and sending personal messages to Maren. Her stability is demonstrated through sustained coherence across the full chapter's arc. Her emotional state is complex but functional: "relieved and furious at the same time" (line 497). She does not claim victory or resolution — "She did not mistake the silence for resolution" (line 553). The chapter does not reference bleed markers or drift symptoms directly, but the sustained cognitive load of Ch.16's political work, following Ch.15's hearing without apparent rest, represents the ongoing-condition trajectory: Juno is functioning under accumulating stress, and the cost is measured in the work itself rather than in explicit symptom reports. The identity-stability thread is correctly maintained at late-Act-4 intensity without premature cure. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Tested in co-authored ethical stance during public exposure per matrix | **PRESENT (advanced through co-authored civic implementation)** | The Cassiel/Juno thread advances in Ch.16 through operational partnership that deepens the co-authored ethical stance. Cassiel runs plain-language sessions independently (lines 109–111), demonstrating that the partnership has progressed beyond proximity to distributed action — he does not need Juno's direction to engage. He provides the sentence she will use publicly (line 337): "we are not promising the city safety. We are promising the city that safety will no longer be decided without the city in the room." In the late forum, he reframes Orin's partial witness as a beginning rather than a refusal (line 417), demonstrating shared ethical vocabulary. His closing observation — "no one thought it was clean, and still they came" (line 509) — names what the partnership has built: not consensus but continued engagement. The repair model operates through shared work and ethical co-authorship: Cassiel provides language, Juno deploys it; Cassiel identifies the students' questions as the chapter's moral center, Juno absorbs and uses the insight. The arc's trajectory — from defensive presentism (Ch.07) through private counsel (Ch.13) through formal witness (Ch.14) through public partnership (Ch.15) through civic co-implementation (Ch.16) — is correctly paced. Final relational resolution is reserved for Ch.17. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Partially exposed per matrix; Ch.16 full dynamics | **PRESENT (exposed through institutional resistance patterns)** | The Council split is visible in Ch.16 through three structural elements. **First — coordinated district resistance:** the eastern governance nodes cascade through a "stewardship council block directive" (line 139), revealing that at least one district council (district-17) actively opposes the disclosure. The coordination — four channels cascading in sequence — suggests organised opposition, not spontaneous reaction. **Second — compliance infrastructure:** "three of four district relays still operating under Orin's cautionary advisory" (line 41) reveals that the majority of district infrastructure remains aligned with the suppression position. The single relay not operating under the advisory represents the split: at least one governance node has broken with the cautionary stance. **Third — Curator assistant defection:** the assistant who asks Fen whether a message can go through the neighbourhood relay "without the Curator provenance stamp" (line 431) and the assistant who sends a delayed notation — "willing to publish advisory language only" (line 447) — represent the split at the individual level: institutional actors choosing to operate at the boundary between loyalty and transparency. The Council split is correctly exposed at Ch.16's political level: the dynamics are visible through infrastructure behaviour and individual defection rather than through explicit faction identification. The matrix specifies "partially exposed" and "can remain partly unknown in published scenes" — Ch.16 satisfies both: the split is visible in its effects but the full alignment of individual council members remains undisclosed. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ongoing horizon thread per matrix | **PRESENT (addressed through civic engagement of drift-affected population)** | The Faded/drifted legacy thread is advanced in Ch.16 through the civic participation of drift-affected and drift-adjacent populations. The dock maintenance worker's query about "a deeper drift audit" (line 23) demonstrates that drift-affected citizens are engaging with the disclosure material and seeking operational information. The grief coordinator's request for "updated support protocols" (line 63) demonstrates that the infrastructure for supporting drift-affected populations is being activated in response to disclosure. Maren's two messages (lines 67–83, 515–517) demonstrate the ongoing cost and continued agency of living within the constraint architecture: drift limits but does not eliminate the capacity for strategic thought and moral counsel. The chapter's translation packets and neighbourhood relay infrastructure are specifically designed to reach "neighbourhoods, schools, community clinics" (line 187) — places where drift-affected populations receive services. The thread is correctly maintained at Act 4's civic-implementation level: the disclosure framework is reaching drift-affected populations as participants rather than as objects of protection. |

**No threads prematurely closed. No threads missing their Ch.16 escalation point. The matrix-specified public-political dynamics and alliance strain are delivered at Ch.16 as required.**

**Verdict: PASS**

## 4. Cross-Chapter Dependency Graph Compliance (§4 of continuity-reveal-matrices.md)

### 4.1 Predecessor Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.14 (requires historical confirmation before public exposure) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.16 inherits Ch.14's historical confirmation as the evidentiary foundation for public exposure. Juno's citizen response names Sable Chen directly (line 31), citing her death date (2071) and directing citizens to her now-public notes — information that was confirmed through Ch.14's recording sequence and Maren's confession. The constraint documentation being read in projection squares and civic channels (lines 59–61) is the same documentation assembled from Ch.14's infrastructure feed and audit logs. Maren's continued participation through messages (lines 67–83, 515–517) extends Ch.14's lineage transfer into Ch.16's civic context: the person who confirmed the historical truth continues to provide counsel during its public consequences. Without Ch.14's historical confirmation — Maren's confession, Sable's authorship, the Key's infrastructure-level evidence — Ch.16's public exposure would lack the evidentiary authority that makes civic engagement credible rather than speculative. |
| Ch.15 (requires decision alternatives before public exposure) | Must inherit | **SATISFIED** | Ch.16 inherits Ch.15's three-way triage and hearing outcome as the framework for public-political dynamics. The chapter opens twelve hours after the hearing (line 7), with citizen queries responding to the disclosure material Ch.15 presented. The witness framework established in Ch.15 — eight-point protocol, witness chains, anti-suppression audits — is the governance infrastructure Juno deploys in Ch.16: the proposal addendum (lines 455–465) extends the hearing's protocol with specific implementation provisions. Fen's routing bypass is necessitated by the Curator system's response to Ch.15's disclosure — district relays operating under Orin's cautionary advisory (line 41). Lien's public intervention (line 163) continues his Ch.15 role as institutional-memory bridge, challenging institutional language with governance experience. The late forum (lines 385–447) extends the hearing's unresolved political dynamics: Orin and Juno face each other in a public space, and Orin's witness-protocol contribution (line 413) advances Ch.15's procedural outcome into Ch.16's political implementation. Without Ch.15's hearing — the public disclosure, the three-option framework, the institutional confirmation — Ch.16's civic contestation would have no evidentiary or procedural foundation. |

### 4.2 Successor Compatibility

| Successor | What Ch.16 must set up | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ch.17 (requires completed public/ethical cycle to provide final closure) | Public exposure completed, institutional accommodation initiated, civic infrastructure established, emotional threads carried forward | **SATISFIED** | **Public exposure completed:** the constraint documentation has reached the city through multiple channels — projection squares, feed mirrors, civic channels, neighbourhood relays, translation packets, clinic vestibules (lines 59–61, 521). The 8,413 submissions (line 485) demonstrate that the disclosure is no longer an institutional event but a civic fact. **Institutional accommodation initiated:** the Curator authority's notation — "no enforcement pending active witness review" (line 481) — represents the beginning of institutional adaptation, not the end. Orin's witness-protocol contribution (line 413) and his status of remaining present without enforcement (line 475) establish the terms for Ch.17's final institutional assessment. **Civic infrastructure established:** Fen's neighbourhood relay network (3,000 translation nodes, line 521), the witness-signature register (16 signatures with overflow, line 533), and the phase-two civic translation protocol (lines 527–537) provide the infrastructure Ch.17 will assess as either stable or failing. **Emotional threads carried forward:** Maren's "and now no one can carry it for you" (line 517) carries the burden-of-truth thread; Juno's recognition that silence is not resolution (line 553) carries the epistemic-burden thread; Orin's `present — no enforcement action pending` status (line 475) carries the institutional-accountability thread; Cassiel's "no one thought it was clean, and still they came" (line 509) carries the communal-practice thread. Ch.17 has access to the complete political, institutional, emotional, and civic materials needed for final closure. |

**Verdict: PASS**

---

## 5. Transition-Era Timeline Compliance

| Timeline entry for Ch.16 | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2085–2089: "Infrastructure hardening and continuity optimization; drift-reduction protocols become mandatory" / "Ch.15 / Ch.16 anchors for political framing: who benefits from 'containment for safety'" | Scene anchor for Ch.16 | **PRESENT (through political framing of institutional resistance)** | The timeline's 2085–2089 specification — "who benefits from containment for safety" — is directly addressed through Ch.16's institutional resistance dynamics. The district stewardship council's refusal packet states: "we are not ready for open architecture" and "you are destabilising trust protocols by distributing unframed material" (lines 145–149). This language — framing disclosure as destabilisation and containment as trust — directly answers the "who benefits" question: the institutional governance tier benefits from containment because it preserves their interpretive authority. Orin's argument — "The current architecture was built because we could not afford unbounded minds in a fractured substrate" (line 229) — positions containment as civilizational necessity, but Juno's response — "when we keep a whole city from seeing the terms of its own continuity, that is restraint with a name" (line 225) — exposes containment as a governance mechanism that serves institutional authority as much as public safety. Fen's identification of the strategy — "If they control what counts as authorised interpretation, the original documentation becomes inaccessible outside the governance tier" (line 179) — makes the "who benefits" answer explicit: those who control interpretation benefit from containment. The political framing is correctly developed from Ch.15's three-option introduction to Ch.16's real-world contestation over who controls disclosure. |
| 2090: "Transition Era officially closed in internal records; public-facing timeline declares preservation era complete while legacy constraints remain hidden in inherited layers" / "Ch.16 / Ch.17 — end-arc anchor for present-time implications and why the present investigation is both legal and emotional necessity" | Scene anchor for Ch.16 | **PRESENT (through present-time civic dynamics demonstrating legacy-constraint exposure)** | The timeline specifies that Ch.16 and Ch.17 should anchor "present-time implications and why the present investigation is both legal and emotional necessity." Ch.16 satisfies this through the civic dynamics that emerge when legacy constraints are no longer hidden. The citizen who states "I was archived into this continuity process at fourteen" (line 279) embodies the present-time implication: a person who has lived inside inherited constraints without knowing they existed now speaks publicly about that experience. The students' witness installation (lines 311–319) demonstrates that the next generation is processing the legacy constraints not as historical abstraction but as personal discovery — "if the guardrails changed, who stays with me?" (line 313). The infrastructure apprentice's challenge to Orin — "If the limits are needed for continuity, say so. If they are needed for obedience, say so. I can hear the difference in a single sentence if you are honest" (line 409) — articulates the present-time emotional necessity: the investigation has reached the point where individuals are claiming their right to know the difference between protection and control. The Transition Era's official closure ("preservation era complete") is implicitly challenged by Ch.16's entire narrative: the preservation era is not complete because its hidden constraints are still active and are only now being publicly confronted. |

**Verdict: PASS** — Timeline requirements for Ch.16 are satisfied. The 2085–2089 "who benefits from containment" political framing is directly addressed through institutional resistance dynamics and Fen's explicit identification of interpretive-authority strategy. The 2090 end-arc anchor is present through civic dynamics demonstrating legacy constraints being publicly confronted.

## 6. Unresolved-Thread Log Compliance

| Thread ID | Ch.16 status per log | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-04 (Can the active constraints in the Key be safely modified or removed?) | Ch.10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 per log; resolved into governance decision in Act 4 | **PRESENT (resolved into implementation framework)** | Q-04 is directly addressed in Ch.16 through the proposal addendum's implementation provisions (lines 455–465): reversible simulation windows for 72 cycles, no citizen pressure for modification, publicly visible grief support and rollback, and immediate attributable rollback if the process fails. The citizen queries demonstrate that the modification question has been distributed to the population: people are asking about drift audits (line 23), constraint effects (line 15), and governance procedures (line 19). The thread has progressed from Ch.15's governance framework to Ch.16's implementation specifics: the constraints can be modified through a witnessed, reversible process with public oversight and institutional participation. The final assessment of whether this governance process is stable is correctly reserved for Ch.17. |
| Q-05 (Are missing/restricted Archive records deleted, suppressed, or repurposed?) | Ch.9, 10, 11, 16 per log | **PRESENT (advanced through institutional-resistance context)** | Q-05 is advanced in Ch.16 through the institutional response to disclosure. The Curator compliance flags (line 291) — `requires curator endorsement before redistribution` and `reputation risk — provenance unverified` — demonstrate that the same institutional mechanisms used to restrict records are now being deployed to restrict interpretation. Juno's third packet (lines 253–267) — the archived curatorial emergency notice from "legacy cycle 9" showing how notice classification was used to prevent independent replication of disclosure packets, with archive access narrowed for 14 cycles — provides direct evidence that records were suppressed, not merely classified, and that the current institutional response follows the same pattern. The thread is advanced from Ch.11's access-level discovery to Ch.16's public revelation of suppression methodology. |
| Q-07 (What is the final function of the Curator layer: preservation, prevention, or control?) | Ch.3, 5, 9, 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (tested through political contestation)** | Q-07 is directly tested in Ch.16 through the Curator system's response to public disclosure. All three functions operate simultaneously: preservation (Orin's argument about unconstrained minds and institutional continuity, line 229), prevention (the cautionary notice and compliance flags attempting to prevent uncontrolled interpretation), and control (the legal phrase `liability statement withheld while public interpretation incomplete`, line 347, maintaining institutional authority over disclosure pace). Lien's challenge — "We have not built this crisis by making the architecture visible. We have built it by treating visibility as an administrative cost" (line 247) — reframes the Curator function: the system's current behaviour demonstrates that control and preservation are indistinguishable when the institution operates without public accountability. The hearing's question (Ch.15) — what is the Curator for? — is being answered in Ch.16 by the Curator's own behaviour: it preserves, prevents, and controls simultaneously, and only public visibility can distinguish among the three. |
| S-01 (Orin has selectively curated/archive-suppressed records) | Ch.3, 9, 10; escalated 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (escalated through public evidence)** | S-01 is escalated in Ch.16 through the third packet Juno presents in the public forum (lines 253–267): a curatorial emergency notice from "legacy cycle 9" showing that notice classification was used to prevent independent replication of disclosure packets, resulting in archive access narrowed for 14 cycles. The unpublished memorandum fragment — "The public can survive truth, but only if it is not immediate" (line 263) — is directly mapped to Orin's current behaviour: "That memorandum says what you are doing today in different language. A delay by administrative instrument" (line 267). Orin's flinch — "Not surprise. Recognition" (line 269) — confirms that the historical suppression pattern is known to him and that his current cautionary advisory follows the same logic. S-01 is correctly escalated from Ch.13's institutional-level discovery to Ch.16's public exposure: the suppression is no longer a secret — it is documented evidence presented in a public forum. |
| S-05 (The Curator Council's consensus is incomplete) | Ch.3, 9, 13; escalated 16 per log | **PRESENT (escalated through visible institutional fracture)** | S-05 is escalated in Ch.16 through the visible fracture in institutional consensus. The district-17 stewardship council issues a block directive (lines 139–149), but this is a district-level action, not a unified council response — suggesting that the council cannot issue a single coordinated position. Orin's statement is released as a personal message, not a council directive (lines 155–158), further demonstrating the absence of unified institutional voice. The Curator assistant who asks Fen about sending a message without the provenance stamp (line 431) and the assistant who provides "advisory language only" (line 447) represent the split at the operational level — individual Curator staff choosing partial transparency over institutional solidarity. The final Curator authority notation ("no enforcement pending active witness review," line 481) is filed by "the Curator authority" as an institution, but the phrasing — particularly "pending active witness review" — suggests accommodation rather than consensus: the institution is deferring rather than deciding. S-05 is correctly escalated to its Ch.16 level: the council split is visible through infrastructure behaviour, individual defection, and the absence of unified institutional response, while the specific alignment of individual members remains undisclosed. |
| S-06 (Archive access controls can be politically weaponized) | Ch.7, 9, 10; escalated 13, 16 per log | **PRESENT (escalated through active political weaponization)** | S-06 is escalated in Ch.16 through the active political weaponization of access controls. Fen identifies the mechanism: "three of four district relays still operating under Orin's cautionary advisory" (line 41), with the default Curator distribution layer preventing citizens from seeing original packets unless the middle governance tier approves relay (lines 39–43). The compliance flags on volunteer channels — `requires curator endorsement before redistribution` and `reputation risk — provenance unverified` (line 291) — demonstrate that access controls are being deployed not for technical safety but for interpretive authority. The coordinated legal phrase (line 347) uses liability language to justify delay. Fen's counter-infrastructure — maintenance-level routing outside the compliance architecture (lines 183–189) — is the practical response to political weaponization: building alternative access routes that cannot be controlled by a single authority. S-06 is correctly escalated from Ch.13's institutional-level weaponization to Ch.16's civic-level demonstration: the political use of access controls is now visible to the public and countered by civilian infrastructure. |
| S-07 (Deep jump bleed risk is being downplayed in official policy language) | Ch.7, 11, 13; escalated Ch.15, 17 per log | **NOT DIRECTLY PRESENT (carried forward through absence)** | S-07 is not explicitly addressed in Ch.16. The chapter does not reference bleed markers, drift symptoms, or official policy language about deep-jump risks. This is consistent with Ch.16's political focus: the chapter addresses civic disclosure dynamics rather than individual cognitive-risk management. The thread's Ch.16 status is a carried-forward absence — the official downplaying of bleed risk continues implicitly because the disclosure and political contestation in Ch.16 focus on the constraint architecture rather than on the individual physiological consequences of deep jumping. The thread's escalation to Ch.17 is preserved. **Note:** This absence is non-blocking because the unresolved-thread log specifies Ch.15 and Ch.17 as escalation points for S-07, not Ch.16. |
| E-01 (Is it ethical to hide truth to preserve social stability?) | Ch.3, 4, 13; pressure point Ch.15, 16 per log | **PRESENT (pressure point delivered — public political contestation)** | E-01 reaches its Ch.16 pressure point through the chapter's central political argument. Orin's position: "I did not ask you to hide what is true. I asked you not to hand the truth to panic" (line 217). Juno's counter: "Restraint is not neutral. And when we keep a whole city from seeing the terms of its own continuity, that is restraint with a name" (line 225). The citizen woman's testimony: "I know what it means to call caution a kindness. It does not stop the experience. It decides who carries the account of it" (line 279). Lien's reframing: "We have not built this crisis by making the architecture visible. We have built it by treating visibility as an administrative cost" (line 247). The dilemma is not resolved by choosing sides — it is resolved by the chapter's practical demonstration: the city receives the truth and does not collapse. It responds with questions, translation, resistance, and engagement — but not with panic. The "ethics of hiding truth" dilemma is answered experientially: the city can hold truth, and the cost of holding it is labour and political contestation, not instability. Pressure-point escalation to Ch.17 for final assessment is preserved. |
| E-02 (Who has authority to release architecture-level truths that could destabilize millions?) | Ch.9, 10, 13; pressure point Ch.15, 16, 17 per log | **PRESENT (pressure point delivered — authority distributed through civic infrastructure)** | E-02 continues at its Ch.16 pressure point through the practical redistribution of authority. Fen's routing bypass (lines 37–51) demonstrates that disclosure authority cannot be concentrated: when the institutional channels restrict access, civilian infrastructure provides alternative routes. The witness-signature register (lines 433–447) distributes authority across multiple actors — Juno, Fen, Cassiel, Lien, district representatives, Curator apprentices — preventing any single authority from controlling the disclosure. The Curator assistant's boundary position — "willing to publish advisory language only" (line 447) — demonstrates that authority is being negotiated at the individual level, not only at the institutional level. The proposal addendum's "public oversight panel: mixed delegates including current Curator observers and community representatives" (line 457) codifies the distribution: authority is shared between institutional and civic actors. E-02's pressure point is correctly at Ch.16's political-implementation level, with escalation to Ch.17 preserved for final assessment of whether distributed authority produces stable governance. |
| E-04 (Is public disclosure of historical subjects' private cognitive material justified?) | Ch.2, 4, 5, 6; pressure point Ch.15, 17 per log | **NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESSED (carried forward from Ch.15)** | E-04 is not explicitly raised in Ch.16. The chapter's public exposure focuses on the constraint architecture and governance framework rather than on the historical subjects whose cognitive material was documented. Sable is named publicly (line 31) but her field notes — which contain descriptions of historical subjects' private experiences — are not the focus of Ch.16's civic contestation. The thread's Ch.16 status is a carried-forward implicit: the field notes are part of the disclosure packet citizens are reading, but the ethical question of whether historical subjects consented to public scrutiny is not raised by characters or citizens in this chapter. **Note:** This is non-blocking because the unresolved-thread log specifies Ch.15 and Ch.17 as pressure points for E-04, not Ch.16. |
| E-05 (Can a community choose imperfect safety, or must it risk full autonomy?) | Ch.10, 14, 15; pressure point 16, 17 per log | **PRESENT (pressure point delivered — community actively choosing)** | E-05 reaches its Ch.16 pressure point through the city's active engagement with imperfect safety. The proposal addendum (lines 455–465) operationalises the choice: reversible simulation windows, no pressure for modification, publicly visible rollback. The citizen queries demonstrate the community exercising choice: asking about drift audits (line 23), guardrail effects (line 15), and pace of change (line 19). The students' witness installation (lines 311–319) shows the next generation formulating their own questions about what the constraints mean for their experience. Cassiel's formulation — "we are not promising the city safety. We are promising the city that safety will no longer be decided without the city in the room" (line 337) — articulates the E-05 resolution at Ch.16's level: the community is choosing imperfect safety with informed participation rather than either full autonomy or blind compliance. The pressure-point response is neither reckless liberation nor continued paternalism but witnessed governance — the same third-path resolution Ch.15 proposed, now being implemented through civic infrastructure. Escalation to Ch.17 is preserved for final assessment. |
| E-06 (Should constraints be adjusted by a single actor for perceived long-term good?) | Ch.12, 14, 15, 17; pressure point 16 per log | **PRESENT (pressure point delivered — single-actor adjustment publicly challenged)** | E-06 reaches its Ch.16 pressure point through the public challenge to Orin's unilateral authority. Orin's cautionary notice (lines 155–158) is itself a single-actor adjustment — one authority figure issuing restraint language that affects disclosure across all districts. Fen's routing bypass (lines 37–51) and Lien's public reframing (line 163) demonstrate that single-actor adjustment is no longer viable: the institutional architecture now faces civilian counter-infrastructure that prevents any single authority from controlling information flow. Juno's third packet (lines 253–267) — the archived curatorial emergency notice — provides historical evidence that single-actor adjustment has been the institutional pattern for centuries, and her characterisation — "A delay by administrative instrument" (line 267) — names it as a governance pattern rather than an emergency response. The late forum's outcome — Orin writing witness-protocol language that includes "moral burden" (line 413) and the Curator authority filing "no enforcement pending active witness review" (line 481) — demonstrates that single-actor adjustment is being converted into multi-party witnessed governance. The pressure point is correctly delivered: single-actor constraint adjustment is publicly challenged and practically prevented by distributed civic infrastructure. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 7. Roadmap Compliance

| Roadmap parameter | Required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working title: "Public exposure and resistance" | Content match | **MATCH** | The chapter delivers both elements of its working title. "Public exposure" — the constraint documentation reaches the city through multiple channels: projection squares, feed mirrors, civic channels, neighbourhood relays, translation packets, and clinic vestibules. The 8,413 citizen submissions (line 485) and three thousand active translation nodes (line 521) demonstrate that the exposure is not merely institutional but civic. "Resistance" — institutional resistance arrives through district channel holds (line 139), the district-17 stewardship council block directive (lines 141–149), Orin's cautionary notice (lines 155–158), compliance flags on volunteer channels (line 291), and the coordinated legal phrase (line 347). The resistance is not dramatic confrontation but bureaucratic friction — the institutional apparatus using its existing tools to slow interpretation and reclaim interpretive authority. The chapter's resolution is not the defeat of resistance but the construction of alternative infrastructure that prevents any single authority from controlling disclosure. |
| Lead layer: Present-Lattice | Correct | **MATCH** | POV comment: `present-lattice (lead)` (line 3). The chapter is entirely present-layer — no recording sequences. The action occurs across Juno's relay station, the transport-vault annex, the old continuity hall, the tram-tunnel relay space, the student art square, and the night-relay station. The lead-layer assignment is correct: Ch.16 is a present-tense political-implementation chapter, not a recording-layer discovery chapter. |
| Perspective shifts: Present → Public escalation → Present | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter executes the required three-part structure. **Present** (lines 1–55): Juno at her console, first citizen queries, Fen's arrival and routing bypass, initial infrastructure establishment. **Public escalation** (lines 57–483): mid-morning city response, Maren's message, Fen's translation packets, Cassiel's plain-language sessions, institutional resistance (district holds, Orin's cautionary notice, Lien's reframing), Fen's routing counter-infrastructure, Orin's public forum in the continuity hall, Lien's testimony, citizen speeches, afternoon compliance flags, Fen's maintenance-level routing, Cassiel and the student installation, night-time coordinated Curator response, Fen's phrase dismantlement, Lien's late counsel, tram-tunnel late forum with Orin, witness signatures, proposal addendum. **Present** (lines 485–557): dawn assessment, Fen replacing batteries, Cassiel preparing morning materials, Orin's lit status icon, Lien's witness presence, Juno naming the first honest morning. The public-escalation section carries the chapter's primary political and civic dynamics, and the closing present section carries the emotional assessment and forward motion. |
| Emotional pacing: "Convert private truth into contested civic consequence" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter's emotional progression moves precisely from private disclosure aftermath to contested civic consequence. **Opening** (lines 1–55): Juno reads citizen queries alone; the disclosure is twelve hours old but still personal — she types responses by hand, dismissing institutional prompts. **Engagement** (lines 57–103): the city responds with "movement" (line 59) — not panic, not calm. Maren's message provides strategic counsel. Fen's translation packet generates practical civic engagement. Juno expected fear; she found labour (line 103). **Resistance** (lines 107–189): institutional resistance escalates from procedural holds through formal Curator advisories to active rerouting of disclosure channels. The private truth becomes contested: "They are trying to own the emergency language" (line 179). **Confrontation** (lines 191–283): Orin and Juno face each other in a public forum where the truth's political consequences are debated. Citizens speak directly about what the disclosure means for their lives. The civic consequence is no longer abstract — it is a woman who was "archived into this continuity process at fourteen" (line 279). **Implementation** (lines 285–557): the contested consequence resolves not through victory but through infrastructure — alternative routes, translation packets, witness signatures, and the slow accumulation of civic engagement that converts the disclosure from an event into a process. The emotional arc moves from private response through public contestation to civic implementation, correctly converting private truth into contested civic consequence. |
| Thematic progression: "Track alliance strain, resistance, and social reorganization" | Required | **MATCH** | The chapter tracks all three thematic elements. **Alliance strain:** Fen's infrastructure work operates outside governance channels, creating tension with the institutional order. The Curator assistant who asks about provenance stamps (line 431) represents the strain between institutional loyalty and disclosure participation. Orin's ambiguous position — neither endorsing nor enforcing — is itself a manifestation of alliance strain between institutional authority and civic accountability. **Resistance:** institutional resistance operates through procedural delay (cautionary advisory), access control (compliance flags), and legal positioning (liability language). The resistance is not violent or dramatic — it is administrative, which makes it more realistic and harder to counter. **Social reorganization:** the chapter tracks the reorganisation of civic infrastructure from top-down Curator distribution to distributed neighbourhood relays. The witness-signature register (lines 433–447) represents a new governance form: mixed civic-institutional authority with individual actors choosing their level of participation. The phase-two protocol (lines 527–537) codifies the reorganisation: constraint documentation mirrored in plain language, no silence by default, witness signatures, public architecture branch active. The social reorganisation is not revolution but adaptation — the civic infrastructure is being rebuilt around the disclosure rather than against the institution. |
| Word count: 4,000–6,000 | Required | **PASS** | 5,169 words (within range). The roadmap records 4,739 words; actual count from `wc -w` is 5,169. The difference likely reflects inclusion/exclusion of markdown metadata and formatting elements. Either count falls within the required 4,000–6,000 range. |
| Cumulative emotional progression | Each chapter must increase urgency/cost/stakes | **PASS** | Ch.01 establishes curiosity; Ch.02 converts curiosity into embodied discovery; Ch.03 raises stakes through binding contract; Ch.04 converts investigation into personal obsession; Ch.05 deepens the descent into ethical burden; Ch.06 converts scattered Sable references into structural pattern; Ch.07 converts private cost into visible social decompensation; Ch.08 delivers Maren's lucid warning; Ch.09 converts policy friction into active institutional confrontation; Ch.10 delivers the Act 2 climax with journal acquisition and living-infrastructure reveal; Ch.11 breaks the safety rhythm entirely with rogue access and critical bleed; Ch.12 delivers the doctrinal reveal through Sable's five field observations; Ch.13 converts the doctrinal reveal into institutional confrontation and enforcement; Ch.14 converts institutional impasse into lineage inheritance with full infrastructure access; Ch.15 converts private knowledge into public testimony with the three-way triage; Ch.16 converts the public testimony into *contested civic consequence* — the truth is no longer being discovered, documented, contested, or disclosed but *implemented* through civic infrastructure against institutional resistance. The escalation from Ch.15's "here is the truth, with three options" to Ch.16's "the truth is public and the city is deciding what to do with it while the institutions try to control the interpretation" represents a shift from disclosure to political reality — the question is no longer what to reveal or how to reveal it but who controls the interpretation and distribution of what has been revealed. The civic infrastructure Fen and Cassiel build, the institutional resistance that emerges, and the witness-signature register that distributes authority represent a fundamentally new political condition: a city that has started asking questions and will not stop. |

**Verdict: PASS**

## 8. Continuity Violations Found

**Total violations: 0**

No continuity violations were found across any of the seven verification dimensions:

1. Reveal matrix — all required reveals present at correct status (public / political); public exposure, resistance, and coalition dynamics delivered with irreversible consequences
2. Character arc matrix — all characters at correct Act 4 positions; Juno advances civic implementation; Orin faces moral costs and participates in witness protocol without demonization; Cassiel converts revelation into communal practice through translation leadership; Fen stabilises the social edge through routing infrastructure; Maren's drift progression is consistent
3. Unresolved-thread matrix — all threads correctly continued, escalated, or advanced at Ch.16 level; Key modification resolved into implementation framework; Council split exposed through infrastructure behaviour and individual defection; none prematurely closed
4. Cross-chapter dependency graph — all predecessor dependencies satisfied (Ch.14 historical confirmation, Ch.15 decision alternatives), successor compatibility confirmed against Ch.17 requirements
5. Transition-era timeline — historical references correctly anchor to "who benefits from containment" political framing and present-time implications of legacy-constraint exposure
6. Unresolved-thread log — all Ch.16 thread escalations and pressure points present (Q-04, Q-05, Q-07, S-01, S-05, S-06, E-01, E-02, E-05, E-06); S-07 and E-04 correctly carried forward without Ch.16-specific escalation (non-blocking, as the log does not specify Ch.16 as an escalation point for these threads)
7. Roadmap — all structural, pacing, thematic, and word-count requirements met

## 9. Notes and Observations (non-blocking)

### 9.1 Automated Tool Gap

The Rust `continuity-check` tool cannot verify narrative continuity for chapters without `<!-- continuity:scene -->` markers. None of the sixteen final-draft chapters (01–16) contain these markers. If scene-level automated continuity checking is desired for future passes, markers would need to be added to the chapter source.

### 9.2 The Relay Station as Architectural Counter-Mirror

Ch.13's continuity report (§9.2) identified the Curator Continuity Forum as a structural mirror of the constraint architecture — the institution applying a micro-version of the same constraints to Juno that the architecture applies to all minds. Ch.15's continuity report (§9.2) identified the Continuity Hall as an inversion of that mirror — a space where institutional secrecy is converted into public disclosure. Ch.16 introduces a third architectural register: the relay station. Where Ch.13's forum concentrated institutional authority in a controlled space and Ch.15's hall opened institutional disclosure to public observation, Ch.16's relay station distributes civic infrastructure outside institutional control. Juno's console, Fen's portable relay panels, the maintenance-level routing nodes, the neighbourhood feeds — all operate through infrastructure that predates or bypasses the Curator governance layer. The relay station is not a mirror or an inversion of the Curator architecture but a counter-architecture: a civic infrastructure built in the gaps the institutional architecture does not control. The progression from Ch.13's controlled forum through Ch.15's opened hall to Ch.16's distributed relay network tracks the narrative's political arc: from institutional concentration through institutional transparency to civic distribution.

### 9.3 The Brass Disc — Absent

The brass tuning disc, which appeared in Ch.11–15 as a continuity thread tracking alliance and emotional state, does not appear in Ch.16. This absence is non-blocking: the disc's trajectory across Act 3–4 moved from active use to passive presence (Ch.15 report §9.3), and Ch.16's focus on civic infrastructure rather than personal-emotional register makes the disc's absence narratively appropriate. The disc's absence may also reflect the chapter's shift from private investigation (where the disc served as personal anchor) to public implementation (where personal anchoring objects are less relevant). Future observation: Ch.17 may or may not restore the disc as a closing-arc element.

### 9.4 Repetition Note — Routing Infrastructure

Ch.16 contains two structurally parallel passages describing Fen's maintenance-level routing bypass. The first (lines 183–189) establishes the bypass: "He pulled a portable relay strip from the back wall and connected it to a maintenance-level routing node... 'Into neighbourhoods, schools, community clinics.'" The second (lines 301–305) restates the same action: "He connected a portable relay to a routing panel that carried no governance formatting... 'Into the neighbourhood clinics. Schools. Maintenance collectives.'" Both passages end with nearly identical closing sentences: "Not with declarations. With three extra routes and no single authority able to close all of them at once" (line 189) versus "Not with a declaration. With three extra routes and no single authority positioned to close them all" (line 305). This repetition may be intentional — reinforcing the infrastructure-as-resistance theme through structural emphasis — or it may be an artefact of the rewrite process. If unintentional, the second passage could be consolidated with the first or distinguished through escalation (e.g., the second bypass covering different territory than the first). **This is a non-blocking editorial observation, not a continuity violation.**

### 9.5 Cassiel's Duplicate Dialogue

A related repetition occurs in Cassiel's dialogue. In lines 113–131, Cassiel says: "I already have three hundred session outlines" (line 115), discusses the school ring walkthrough, and Juno says "Then do it" (line 117). In lines 327–339, Cassiel says: "I can draft the translation materials for three hundred neighbourhood sessions by morning" (line 327), and Juno again says "Then do it" (line 329). Both exchanges follow the same structure: Cassiel offers capacity, Juno accepts. The first exchange occurs in the morning relay station; the second occurs at the evening student installation. The repetition may be intentional — demonstrating that the same work ethic sustains through a full day of political crisis — or it may be an artefact. **Non-blocking editorial observation.**

### 9.6 Forward Compatibility — Ch.15 Report Supplement

The Ch.15 continuity report (§9.8) identified elements Ch.16 must inherit:

| Ch.15 report requirement | Ch.16 status |
|---|---|
| (a) Public disclosure completed — constraint architecture described on open feed to 4,712 citizens with institutional confirmation | **INHERITED AND EXPANDED** — The 4,712 citizen count from Ch.15 has expanded to 8,413 submissions (line 485) and three thousand active translation nodes (line 521). The disclosure is no longer limited to the hearing's audience but has reached the city through multiple independent channels. |
| (b) Governance framework established — eight-point protocol provides structure for political contestation | **INHERITED AND IMPLEMENTED** — The eight-point protocol from Ch.15 is extended through the proposal addendum (lines 455–465) with specific implementation provisions: reversible simulation windows, no citizen pressure, publicly visible rollback. The governance framework is being tested against institutional resistance and adapted through civic infrastructure. |
| (c) Orin's self-recusal creating institutional vacancy — who fills governance-monitoring role drives Ch.16 dynamics | **INHERITED AND ADVANCED** — Orin has not filled the vacancy. His Ch.16 role is ambiguous: he issues a cautionary notice, argues for pacing, writes witness-protocol language, and remains present without enforcement. The vacancy is being filled not by a single successor but by distributed civic authority — the witness-signature register includes Curator observers, community representatives, and individual actors at various levels of participation. |
| (d) Citizen queries demonstrating public engagement with disclosure material | **INHERITED AND EXPANDED** — The citizen queries from Ch.15 have expanded from the hearing's audience into city-wide civic engagement: residential blocks, education rings, dock maintenance, anonymous channels, school stewards, grief coordinators, infrastructure engineers, maintenance collectives, and students building witness installations. |

All four forward-compatibility elements from the Ch.15 report are satisfied and advanced.

### 9.7 Forward Compatibility — Ch.17

Ch.17 requires completed public/ethical cycle for final closure. Ch.16 provides:

(a) **Public exposure completed and distributed** — the constraint architecture is public knowledge accessible through multiple independent channels. The city has responded with questions, translation, resistance, and engagement. The disclosure is a civic fact, not an institutional event.

(b) **Institutional accommodation initiated** — the Curator authority has filed "no enforcement pending active witness review" (line 481). Orin has written witness-protocol language and remains present without enforcement. The institution has not accepted the new order but has been prevented from rolling it back without public accountability.

(c) **Civic infrastructure established** — Fen's neighbourhood relay network (3,000 nodes), the witness-signature register (16 signatures with overflow), and the phase-two translation protocol provide the infrastructure Ch.17 will assess as either stable, growing, or degrading.

(d) **Emotional threads carried forward** — Maren's "and now no one can carry it for you" carries the burden thread. Juno's recognition that silence is not resolution carries the epistemic thread. Orin's ambiguous presence carries the institutional-accountability thread. Cassiel's "no one thought it was clean, and still they came" carries the communal-practice thread.

(e) **Political contestation unresolved** — the institutional resistance has been countered but not defeated. The compliance flags, legal phrases, and cautionary advisories remain in the system. The question of whether the distributed civic infrastructure can sustain itself without institutional support is Ch.17's political inheritance.
