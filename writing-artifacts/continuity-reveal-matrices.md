# Infinite Domain — Continuity, Reveal, and Dependency Matrices (Task #6)

Last updated: 2026-02-13  
Scope: Acts 1–4 (`chapter-01` through `chapter-17`)

This file formalizes continuity, reveal cadence, unresolved-thread status, and chapter
dependencies so the first four acts remain causally coherent and pacing-safe.

## 1) Character arc continuity matrix

| Character | Act 1 (Ch.01–04) | Act 2 (Ch.05–10) | Act 3 (Ch.11–14) | Act 4 (Ch.15–17) | Continuity risk to watch |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Juno Alcázar-Reed | Present-life isolation is established, with professional competence and emotional withholding. First signs of private fixation appear after initial Archive work (orphaned urgency for the Rosetta trail). | Obsession becomes visible in work habits and behavior around Orin, while bleed starts to affect ordinary decision-making. She keeps risk hidden, creating stress fractures in trust. | She chooses rogue jump behavior and accepts overt risk; emotional and cognitive costs are explicit and no longer recoverable as "just exhaustion." | She resolves the epistemic burden by exposing design truth without collapsing the polity, and chooses a constrained-but-transparent path instead of suppression or dissolution. | If Act 2 beats suggest obsession too early, later restraint in Act 3 can feel inauthentic. |
| Orin Thalassa | Introduced as trusted Curator and commissioning authority with no overt cracks. | Restrictive responses and selective omissions accumulate; his protective posture hardens under increased scrutiny from Juno. | Becomes explicit gatekeeper and enforcer; moves from persuasion to operational containment. | Faces public and moral costs of long-term custodial deception but is not demonized as purely villainous. | Overexposure of Orin’s intentions before Juno’s evidence is solid can flatten conflict. |
| Maren Alcázar | Presented as drifted elder and emotional anchor; visits are stabilizing but increasingly painful. | Opaque lucid moment introduces a pre-seeded reference that seems incoherent but points to Key design. | Full confirmation of past knowledge and responsibility appears in a late Act 3 testimony context. | Serves as final emotional referendum on whether truth can be held without breaking relational love. | Her drift progression must stay consistent with scene frequency and detail density to remain believable. |
| Cassiel Vey | Established history with Juno; emotional distance is already present but defined. | Returns from distance and re-enters conflict, creating friction and hope in equal measure. | Becomes explicit ethical counterweight to suppression logic and proves willing to risk position for Juno. | Helps convert revelation into a communal practice of living with uncertainty. | Keep Cassiel’s acceptance arc from “defensive presentism” to “ethical partnership” paced and earned. |
| Fen Maro | Supportive colleague/peer witness in Act 1, mostly external observer. | First risk alarm role emerges as Juno’s behavior degrades, moving from concern to intervention. | Fully allied with Juno’s high-risk phase, while retaining practical fears and questions. | Helps stabilize outcomes at the social edge of public exposure and aftermath. | Fen’s credibility can drop if concern is too abrupt; seed practical observations earlier. |
| Dr. Lena Orlov | Introduced via peripheral and then major jumps that carry physical-sensory texture. | Thread gains moral complexity: ethical costs, consent limits, and early system warnings. | Her warnings become active interpretation layers for Juno’s present decisions. | Functions as historical conscience whose earlier cautions are validated by current constraints. | Avoid turning Lena into a perfect prophet; keep her uncertainty and fatigue visible. |
| Marcus Fell | Peripheral to Juno’s frame in Act 1 as part of Engram team context. | Represented as technical rationalization pressure and rollout bias. | Seen as one pole of pragmatic suppression: system continuity over moral warning. | Can become a late-stage foil or silent beneficiary of institutional continuity. | If introduced too late, technical pushback in policy scenes can feel like an info dump. |
| Sable Chen | Peripheral motif in recording noise (names, methods, code fingerprints). | Moves from hint to trace evidence, especially around hidden safeguards and anomaly logs. | First direct architecture-level revelations: active constraints and maintenance loops. | Core design ethics become emotionally legible and no longer only plot mechanism. | Ensure Sable’s complexity persists (protector and limiter in tension), not binary genius/mistake framing. |
| Curator system | Presented as legitimate governance mechanism and access hierarchy. | Its selective curation methods become visibly interventionist through missing/deleted entries. | Enforcement layer is activated against rogue access, converting policy into coercion risk. | Legitimacy is re-negotiated publicly; truth release challenge reframes Curator authority. | Do not shift Curator behavior from rule-based governance to omnipotent villainy too quickly. |
| Faded/Drifted legacy | Introduced as warning horizon in setting and Maren’s trajectory. | Functions as escalating emotional forecast for what unchecked drift can become. | Reinforces cost of concealment and continuity failure. | Marks the moral center of why transparency and consent, not fear, must drive Act 4 resolution. | If Faded are too abstract, stakes become symbolic and lose narrative force. |

## 2) Reveal matrix by chapter (Act 1–Act 4)

| Chapter | Primary reveal content | Reveal status | Why it must come here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Lattice life, Juno’s emotional baseline, Maren relationship, and baseline Curator legitimacy. | Early / public | Required orientation: place the reader in present stakes before history intrusion. |
| 02 | Embodied texture of Archive jumps and first externalized curiosity; no major governance truth. | Seeded | Introduces mind-jump phenomenology and keeps ethical ambiguity low enough to avoid early saturation. |
| 03 | Orin’s commission, unusual compensation, and first practical limits on data paths. | Seeded / partial | Starts the external pressure engine while preserving uncertainty about Orin’s motives. |
| 04 | Transformative Lena jump and marked behavioral change in Juno. | Partial / seed-to-public pivot | End-Act 1 emotional hinge that converts curiosity into obsession. |
| 05 | First sustained Engram arc continuity and ethical strain in the historical record. | Public within historical layer | Establishes that current stakes come from unresolved design decisions, not mere mystery. |
| 06 | Sable appears more often as an architectural shadow pattern. | Seeded | Creates investigative pattern that justifies later journal-seeking. |
| 07 | Juno’s present decompensation, Fen alarm, Cassiel re-entry. | Seeded / public | Transfers mystery into social cost and relationship accountability. |
| 08 | Maren’s lucid warning with cryptic Rosetta language. | Seeded / delayed | Establishes emotional proof from a witness Juno cannot ignore; prevents Act 3 surprise without early exposition. |
| 09 | Restricted archive barriers are concretely encountered; Orin deflection documented. | Public / frictional reveal | Turns abstract policy into active obstruction and validates suspecting suppression. |
| 10 | Sable private records are acquired; Rosetta Key recognized as living infrastructure. | Public (major) | First hard inflection: mystery becomes system reality and Act 2 climax. |
| 11 | Rogue jumps and explicit severe bleed risks. | Public | Forces irreversible escalation in Juno behavior and narrows the moral alternatives. |
| 12 | Sable’s design architecture is directly experienced: constraints are active, intentional, and stabilizing. | Public / doctrinal reveal | Core mechanics of “freedom vs stability” are now knowable and can be debated publicly. |
| 13 | Orin and Curator enforcement escalation is formalized as institutional policy response. | Public (operational) | Shifts antagonism from personality conflict to governance structure. |
| 14 | Maren confirms prior-generation knowledge and Juno gains direct Key access. | Public (late) | Delivers closure to long-seeded emotional and historical claims before decision act. |
| 15 | Juno’s triage alternatives become explicit: remove constraints, suppress truth, or open truth with agency. | Public (strategic) | Establishes the ethical center of Act 4 before public crisis begins. |
| 16 | Public exposure, resistance, and coalition dynamics with Cassiel/Fen. | Public (political) | Converts private revelation into social event with irreversible consequences. |
| 17 | Outcome matrix: mixed futures, Maren closure, and post-surprise Lattice baseline. | Public / emotional resolution | Closes disclosed threads and maps what remains legitimately uncertain. |

## 3) Unresolved-thread matrix

| Thread | Seeded | Open through | Expected resolution point | Dependency | Continuity risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Why Maren feared the Key | Ch.08, strengthened Ch.14 | Ch.17 | Partially closed by Ch.14 emotional confession; final impact tested in Ch.17 | Juno trust in Maren + oral confirmation | If unresolved too long, Maren’s warning can feel arbitrary. |
| Whether Orin’s suppression is malicious or protective | Ch.03, Ch.09 | Ch.14 | Mostly resolved by Ch.13–14 when motives are contrasted against outcomes | Curator policy proof, missing-restriction trail | If closed too early, Act 4 ethics loses tension. |
| Whether the Key can be safely removed | Ch.10 | Ch.15, Ch.17 | Resolved through open-governance process in Act 4, not immediate binary verdict | Act 3 mechanical reveal and Act 4 political sequence | Early answer risks replacing dilemma with technical puzzle. |
| Full meaning of Sable’s “constraints” | Ch.06–10 (hints), Ch.12 (exposition) | Ch.12 | Core meaning resolved as moral/structural paradox in Ch.17 | Act 3 direct exposure + Maren contextualization | If reduced to trope, Sable’s arc loses distinctiveness and stakes. |
| Stability of Juno’s identity under sustained stress | Ch.02–04 hints, Ch.07, Ch.11 | Ch.17 | Continues as ongoing character condition with no static cure | Bleed mechanics + support network | If resolved too cleanly, Act 1–3 cost arc becomes decorative. |
| Cassiel/Juno emotional repair model | Ch.07, Ch.13 | Ch.17 | Tested in co-authored ethical stance during public exposure; finalized in farewell sequence | Acts 4 choice and aftermath scenes | If deferred, relationship can become perfunctory closure. |
| Council split dynamics (who supports Orin) | Ch.09, Ch.13 | Ch.16 | Partially exposed through resistance scenes, can remain partly unknown in published scenes | Curator enforcement and public reactions | Over-explaining can over-serialize governance into paperwork. |
| Fate of Faded and drifted legacies | Ch.01, Ch.08 | Ch.17 | Ongoing horizon thread; no total closure required | Maren trajectory + Ch.17 emotional benchmark | If ignored, continuity cost of living within limits collapses into abstraction. |

## 4) Cross-chapter dependency graph (Act 1 → Act 4)

### 4.1 Predecessor matrix (operational dependencies)

| Chapter | Must inherit from these chapter(s) | Dependency type |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | — | Baseline orientation and actor definitions. |
| 02 | 01 | Requires Lattice baseline for jump contrast and sensation framing. |
| 03 | 01, 02 | Requires present baseline and jump capability context before commission stakes. |
| 04 | 01–03 | Requires commission, growing dependence, and jump mechanism familiarity. |
| 05 | 02, 04 | Requires early jump momentum and narrative permission for deeper Engram reconstruction. |
| 06 | 04, 05 | Requires seeded mystery plus technical context for repeat pattern recognition. |
| 07 | 05, 06 | Requires social cost signals already active around obsession and suspicion. |
| 08 | 06, 07 | Needs pattern recognition and social strain to make Maren warning actionable. |
| 09 | 03, 08 | Needs Orin authority context and Maren-horizon to justify archive obstruction urgency. |
| 10 | 09 | Requires obstruction + suspicion before infrastructure reveal lands as coherent escalation. |
| 11 | 10 | Requires act-level awareness that restricted truths are active and consequential. |
| 12 | 10, 11 | Requires Ch.10’s living-process reveal and Ch.11 risk posture. |
| 13 | 11, 12 | Requires proven danger and proof of constraints to motivate enforcement escalation. |
| 14 | 08, 13, 12 | Requires emotional proof (Maren) and doctrinal proof (constraints/containment) before Key access. |
| 15 | 14 | Requires resolved truth access to frame decision architecture credibly. |
| 16 | 14, 15 | Requires Ch.14 historical confirmation and Ch.15 decision alternatives before public exposure. |
| 17 | 15, 16 | Requires completed public/ethical cycle to provide final closure. |

### 4.3 Dependency integrity notes

- No chapter in Acts 1–4 should advance a technical truth before emotional, social, and procedural prerequisites are established in earlier chapters.
- Orin’s moral ambiguity is preserved by delaying explicit “protection-through-deception” closure until after Ch.13.
- Sable’s constraint architecture must remain inferential from Ch.06 onward and only explicitly diagrammed at Ch.12 or later.
- Ch.17 can retain limited horizon uncertainty while still resolving immediate social consequence.
