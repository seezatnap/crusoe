# Infinite Domain — Style and Voice Protocol

Task tie-in: `#8` (Define the style-and-voice protocol for prose in the style of J. K. Rowling)
Last updated: 2026-02-13

## Purpose

This protocol defines required prose posture for all chapter drafting and revision in `chapters/`.
It supplements:

- `writing-artifacts/setting-bible.md`
- `writing-artifacts/character-bible.md`
- `writing-artifacts/roadmap.md` (chapter-layer alternation and pacing)

Drafting is not complete until the chapter satisfies both the roadmap rules and this protocol.

## Core voice model

The target is **clear, character-forward, humane, and quietly escalating**.

- Rowling-like scene-first architecture: emotion and revelation are driven by character behavior, consequence, and a few concrete details before abstraction.
- Character logic first: point of view should feel anchored in what a character can observe, remember, fear, and choose.
- Momentum is maintained through concrete action, social pressure, and moral choice, not explanatory summaries.
- Clarity should come from scene mechanics and motivation; tonal impact should arrive through what a scene forces a character to do.

Drafting guardrail:

- A paragraph should carry one pressure point clearly; if two stakes are present, bridge them inside the scene’s causality.
- If a sentence can be shortened without weakening rhythm, shorten it.
- If a metaphor clouds meaning, remove it and replace with concrete action or sensory fact.

## Anti-cliché constraints

### Hard constraints

- Do not use known emotional shorthand labels (for example: “shattered,” “devastated,” “heartbroken,” “on the brink,” “at her wit’s end,” “breaks her heart,” “a ghost of a smile”) as narration shortcuts.
- Do not use generic “atmosphere” language as emotional substitute (for example: “the air hung heavy,” “the silence screamed,” “time stood still,” “numb as stone”).
- Do not define a character by label (“strong,” “broken,” “naive,” “cold,” “purely kind”) without evidence in action, dialogue, and consequence.
- Do not use “as if” chains repeatedly to explain emotional states.
- Do not announce moral conclusions in narrator language (“this proved that...,” “she knew now forever”). Let meaning emerge through action, reaction, and aftermath.
- No decorative chapter openers (“It was the kind of morning that changed everything”). Every opening sentence must do concrete scene work.

### Repetition constraints

- Avoid repeating any sentence opening pattern more than twice in a row within a chapter.
- Avoid repeating a non-essential verb phrase more than three times across neighboring paragraphs.
- Avoid repeating a key metaphor family across two adjacent chapters unless the repeat is intentional and tied to progression (e.g., the same motif under changing stakes).

### Allowed exception pattern

- A repeated phrase may appear only when it is the artifact of character voice or memory residue and the repetition is meaning-bearing (for example, recurring code words, ritual language, or drift symptoms).

## Editorial anti-patterns to eliminate

- **Techno-babble as authority**: do not present concept mechanics as “officially simple.” Explain through observation, consequence, and one human response.
- **Information burst paragraphs**: no dense exposition blocks. Information must be attached to concrete scene stakes.
- **Emotionally flat summaries**: avoid telling the reader a character “understood everything”; demonstrate that understanding through a specific, irreversible choice.
- **Hyperactive scene transitions**: transitions must feel motivated by memory, interruption, or risk, not by paragraph management.

## Lattice vs Recording chapter tone rules

### Shared baseline

- Every chapter must preserve emotional restraint and precise mechanics.
- Dialogue should be driven by intention and interruption, with minimal tags and maximum stage direction (posture, glance, delay).
- Character response should arrive as posture, breath, gesture, time taken, and choice.

### Present-Lattice chapters (abstract-present texture)

Use when lead layer is Present-Lattice.

- Preferred register: conceptual, architectural, social, and behavioral.
- Space is unstable and consensual: treat locations as formed by intention and collective pressure.
- Sensory description is selective, not immersive world-building.
- Emphasis is on the cost of continuity: pauses, edits in thought, memory distortion, social distance, governance pressure.
- Rhythm: controlled sentence variation, with short-to-medium sentences in pressure moments and longer sentences for reflective turn-backs.
- Endings: should often land on a practical consequence rather than an emotional declaration.

### Recording chapters (physical-past texture)

Use when lead layer is Recording.

- Preferred register: embodied, concrete, sensory, and local.
- Prioritize bodily sensation and immediate setting details (weather, smell, fatigue, time, light, physical labor, small discomforts).
- Show ethical friction through ordinary details: consent paperwork, coffee smell, tired eyes, cramped posture, institutional routine.
- Rhythm: allow fuller scene texture in recording chapters, but keep thought tied to immediate perception and present consequence.
- Endings: should register emotional cost in physical residue (e.g., altered gait, withheld gesture, cramped hands, insomnia carryover).

### Alternation implementation

- Follow the chapter-level lead-layer order in `writing-artifacts/roadmap.md` by default.
- If a chapter departs from the alternation matrix, log a reason in local draft notes and the corresponding chapter postmortem.
- Lattice leads must begin with a present-tense social/structural pressure scene unless explicitly marked as single-layer.
- Recording leads should begin with an embodied entry point (location, body state, or environmental detail) before analysis.
- Between chapter types, maintain a perceivable tonal contrast: abstraction in the Lattice, embodied specificity in recordings.

## Tone progression by arc context

### Act 1
- Curiosity-led restraint, controlled emotional opening.
- Introduce stakes by showing what is hidden, not by explaining the hidden policy directly.

### Act 2
- Increase fatigue and behavioral asymmetry.
- Keep revelations measured; let readers sense instability before each explicit naming.

### Act 3
- Increase inevitability and cost density.
- Increase sentence precision around moral and technical choices.

### Act 4
- Keep prose calm enough to hold contradictory outcomes at once.
- The final truth should be held in concrete action, with minimal authorial interpretation.

## Draft compliance checklist (for each chapter)

Before considering a chapter draft complete, run this list and record any exception:

1. Does the prose stay specific and avoid abstraction drift for the chapter’s lead layer?
2. Are emotional turns shown through behavior rather than statement?
3. Is there at least one line of emotional clarity that lands through image + action, not narration?
4. Did the paragraph cadence vary enough to avoid uniform rhythm?
5. Are prohibited cliche patterns absent except where character-specific repetition is intentional?
6. Does the chapter’s tone contrast appropriately with the preceding chapter per lead-layer alternation?
7. Do scene transitions emerge from character pressure, risk, or memory residue, not list-like plotting?

## Authorial signature rules

- Use precise verbs and specific nouns over ornamental adjectives.
- Prefer uncertainty stated through action, not explanatory certainty.
- Keep each chapter’s emotional weight controlled, then release intensity through a single, concrete turn.
