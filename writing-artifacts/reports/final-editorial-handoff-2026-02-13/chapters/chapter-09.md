# Chapter 09
## The Missing Hour

By the time the Archive was due to close for the night, the corridor clocks had moved from cautious glows of amber to the tired yellow of old metal. The whole wing had that late-hour smell of warmed circuitry and damp dust--the scent of books too small to be books, of boxes no one had opened in years, of old varnish and overheated brass. Juno stood at the edge of Bay Three, hands on the back of a chair that had not yet accepted her weight in a day's span of use, watching the narrow strip of green light on the wall like it might answer a question all by itself.

She had spent the better part of three hours trying to reconcile two audio logs from the same week, and each attempt only made the same thing sit up a little straighter in her mind: there were holes where there should have been continuity. Not static, not brief drop-outs from atmospheric interference, but clean erasures. Smooth as varnish scrubbed from glass.

In the archive's indexing room, the glass walls looked out over rows of standing cabinets: each cabinet stamped with dates, routes, district codes, and names she had learned to trust only when every drawer seemed to agree. She had always trusted systems in pieces, never whole. Systems were patient liars. But systems were at least honest about lying every day if you knew how to ask.

She tapped the final query on her slate with two fingers and opened the folder marked **ORB-1177: Night Council Proceedings**. The first five minutes loaded cleanly: the hall chatter, Orin's measured introduction, the faint scrape of someone turning pages. Then, at minute six, the stream jumped abruptly to minute twenty-two.

Six minutes simply gone.

Another file.

She searched around the timestamp and found the same segment indexed in three mirrors, as a duplicate for redundancy. All three were missing the same gap.

She muttered, "Not enough power in that run?"

No one answered. In the next alcove, the night archivist was slumped over her own screen, a thermos forgotten beside the keyboard, still asleep through whatever emergency had entered the room in spirit if not in fact.

Juno stood and crossed to the terminal stack at the center of the room. The air there hummed; the racks were old, and the old liked to hum when someone touched them out of turn. She fed in the local admin key and opened the raw packet manifest.

The manifest listed one hundred and four discrete recordings for the hearing.

She had the list open as a line of small lights, each with one letter code in front:

- A: accessible
- P: partial
- X: restricted
- M: missing

When she had taught herself the archive language in her first month as junior reviewer, she had treated the markings like weather terms. A meant clear sky. X meant storm. M meant bad roads.

Now there were eleven Ms.

She said out loud, "Eleven missing. And four restricted."

She copied the list to a fresh scratchpad. Her pulse was already too fast for her own rhythm. A bad sign when the pulse began narrating before your thought caught up.

At the top of the list, just under the header, were two lines in the remarks field: **RESTRICTED ACCESS GRANTED**.

No timestamp. No name. No date. No reason.

Juno sat back, rubbing at the bridge of her nose. She could almost hear the sentence from chapter two's orientation lecture repeating itself in her memory, in that calm, bored voice from Compliance training: _When systems redact, they leave trails for auditors. If there is no trail, assume manual override._

That lesson had felt theoretical then. Now the room seemed to press inward.

She had not told anyone she'd started this line of inquiry. Not yet. Or perhaps not yet because she did not want to be wise before she had evidence. But she had also learned, in the month since she had come under Orin's wing, that Orin preferred people who brought him partial facts with clear outlines over people who came in with dramatic certainties. If she had walked into his office shouting "You covered something up," he would have smiled, offered tea, and changed the topic.

So she did not walk in with that. She wrote a cleaner message.

> **To Orin: I found gaps in ORB-1177. Need reconciliation on restricted/ missing markers. Could you confirm transfer integrity?**

She sent it through the internal line. No reply.

Then she checked the mirror of the same session from District Record Keep. If the Archive had gaps, maybe another department had a clean copy, as all the legends insisted and as all the budgets denied.

She opened the portal. Same listing, different route. Same pattern. All eleven missing. Four restricted now coded as **X-X-X** by the local ethics layer, and still no handler signature.

She felt a chill that had nothing to do with room temperature when she found the first redirection: an identical packet at minute nineteen in ORB-1177 carried a checksum that matched exactly a packet from ORB-1132, a different hearing. Same laughter in the background, the same scrape of chair legs, the same cough. But the dates were different by thirty-four days. Someone had duplicated audio to fill a gap, not to preserve history but to pad an absence.

Juno reached for her pen and then stopped. Pen was old habit; now she wrote in a digital note anyway.

It occurred to her that a person could stage a neat disappearance in the data and still leave the emotional shape of their lie intact. The same way a room could be rearranged and still smell like tea.

She made three neat columns:

1. expected index
2. present index
3. observed marker (M, X, duplicate, or altered
)

Across the top she wrote: **Need cross-validation by custodian**.

She wrote the phrase slowly, as she marked each letter to keep the whole thing together.

The night archivist coughed once and slid down in her chair as though she had dreamed the movement and then remembered she was asleep. Juno almost laughed at the absurdity of it: this was the hour for revelations, and the closest anyone got was a snore.

She stood to get a fresh mug of water and found it already gone cold. Her reflection in the stainless cabinet looked stranger than her own panic--jaw set, eyes too bright, chin tipped up in a way she never used at the office. She was angry at missing recordings, but the anger came with something sharper underneath, a fear she still did not know how to name.

A small tone pinged from her slate. Orin had replied.

> **Busy. Come to the Lower Deck Office at 21:00. Bring the list.**

There it was, if he knew exactly what she'd discover and decided the place for it before it happened. She could have ignored him and escalated directly to the oversight committee. She could have asked for a review from legal, or copied everything and disappeared from his line before the next dawn. Instead she took down her coat and told herself that one meeting with Orin was still one conversation, and not yet a wall.

She checked the clock above the door. Twenty past eight. Nearly an hour until the summons.

She didn't go to the office immediately. She went first to the stairwell that wound through the central spine of the Archive and came up against the old glass panels where the building's old cooling system vented in thin breathy jets. From there, the city stretched under the glass in a broken ring of lamps. A little fog rolled along the avenue two levels below. It was quiet in that way before midnight when the city itself seemed to hold its own breath.

Juno stood very still and listened.

She had learned that if she listened too hard to every sound, she would eventually confuse memory and data for one another. The scrape of a maintenance bot on metal. A cart wheel. Wind. The low complaint of old hydraulics. She had no way to know which one meant "something has shifted."

When the clock struck twenty-nine, she pressed the elevator button for Lower Deck. The doors slid open with a long metallic sigh.


Orin's office was on Level Seven below the Archive floor, and the way down felt like sinking into old water. One floor, one floor, one floor. The doors opened to a broad strip corridor lit in narrow bars, each bar reflected in polished steel so that the room looked twice as long as it was. On the walls were old photographs of construction crews, all of them in bright old coats and impossible hats, smiling at camera fronts as though they might have known they'd be forgotten. There was always this absurd mismatch in the building: precision architecture and careless faces.

At the end of the corridor, Orin's door bore no plate and no handle; it opened with one palm to the right of the brass latch. He had the same way with his words.

She knocked anyway.

No answer. The door was ajar by half a hand.

He stood by the window with his back to her, long coat off, sleeves rolled up as though he had come to this meeting out of practical duty rather than command. He did not turn. He said, "You've been in the records long. You look like you've met a ghost."

She stepped inside and, keeping her slate angled by her side, said, "That's a strange diagnosis."

He glanced over one shoulder and said, "I've just had a day in the lower vault. If you want ghosts, go to the top level on a rain night."

There was a desk lamp between them, low and amber, and a tray with two cups that had gone cold. Outside the window the city made itself into a grid of dull red and silver. He held his hands together and watched her in a way she had come to classify as his patient mode--the one he used before saying no.

She said, "Talk."

He gestured toward the chair nearest the desk and said, "Sit first. We can be civil."

She sat. He sat opposite, leaned back until the chair complained, then settled into stillness.

He asked, "Found something?"

She opened the slate and brought the marker table into his line of sight. She said, "From ORB-1177. Eleven missing segments. Four restricted. All copies identical."

His brows pinched in what could have been surprise if not well-practiced. He said, "There are sometimes routine redactions. What appears missing in one view may be intentionally redacted under legal hold."

She said, "No, that's not my first question. Why are identical gaps mirrored across district copies? Why does it look like someone duplicated another hearing to fill the holes?"

He said, almost gentle, "No, not exactly. Systems fail. A batch upload can propagate one error to all nodes. You know this."

She did not. Or rather, she knew the theory, but not this kind of neatness.

She tapped the slate where she had circled a missing interval. She said, "Minute six to minute ten. Completely missing. It begins right after your opening remarks."

He reached for the cup nearest him and picked it up as though he'd forgotten what was in it. He said, "At that point, the session room was under emergency redirection for security reasons."

She asked, "How emergency?"

He said, "Council-level. You are not in that chain."

A pause. He said, "And this is precisely why your access is limited."

He said, "Limited. Your access wasn't limited before you requested deeper context."

He said, "Because you asked for deeper context, and this is the first thing you need to hear: you're curious in a way that can become dangerous."

She felt the words land like a stone and then watched him for the smallest shift in breathing. She asked, "Is that why the restricted tags read as restricted and not legal hold?"

He smiled with his mouth closed and his eyes elsewhere. He said, "That is a narrow reading."

She held his gaze. She said, "That isn't a narrow recording."

He gave her no answer.

In the stillness, the lamp hummed. She could hear paper rasp. It might have been the papers on his desk, maybe a file turning with air from a hidden vent.

She said, "Show me the chain."

He lifted one brow and said, "On this floor? You came with that list, not with a request form. You can still request. Properly. You can send it through the channels, and I can process."

She did not like this answer because it offered compliance instead of explanation. She asked, "So you're saying there was an emergency, but there's no audit trail?"

He sat forward a little, forearms on the desk, and said, "There was an emergency protocol that day, and yes, some streams are sealed."

She asked, "By who?"

By what. She had corrected herself just before she said it. By who.

The question landed between them and did not get a reply.

Orin reached for the side drawer and tapped three times on the lock plate. It did not open.

Juno felt the motion in her chest. He was stalling, maybe intentionally. She watched the vein in his left hand gather as he lifted the hand again and set it down, this time without touching anything.

He said, watching her too quickly, "Could be an interagency review. You know how things go when the old statutes are invoked. I can't release what I can't confirm."

She said, "Then pass the question up."

He said, "Up where?"

She said, "To oversight. Legal. Anyone with the authority to authorize emergency seals."

He said, tapping the table once, "There are channels for that. You're not on one."

She asked, "What does that mean exactly?"

He answered with a tone that made him sound both patient and exhausted by children. He said, "That means the chain is not yours, and I have a professional duty to keep you from overreaching."

Juno let that settle. She said, "This is not overreaching. This is a discrepancy in official records."

His expression sharpened. He said, "All records are discrepancies if you look from the wrong frame, Juno. You're reading a sequence and believing it is truth. Sometimes a redaction is the only way to keep truth alive."

The sentence was theatrical. She had heard something like it in chapter three from a witness who used too many abstractions whenever pressed. Orin always moved to abstraction when he wanted to avoid dates.

She folded her hands. She said, "Your instruction still applies, but the gaps are in the same format as the missing minutes. You told me yourself during training not to trust a single layer. I am asking you to let me trust a second one."

He exhaled through his nose and looked at his hands. He said, "Second-layer requests are useful, Juno, and they become an expensive habit."

She asked, "Cost to whom?"

He said, "Cost to everyone who still has a place in the machine, and you are part of it now."

She knew this line. It was from a speech he had given six months ago about discretion and duty. It was one of those polished speeches that sounded like caution in front of a fire and like a threat in a dark stairwell.

The next silence was too clean. Juno felt the heat of the lamp settle on her hands.

She set the slate flat, to make a table feel less fragile.

She asked, "Did you personally authorize a duplicate fill for missing minutes?"

He gave the smallest tilt of his head, half-confession, half-warning. He said, "The system may do many things."

She said, "This is not an answer."

He shrugged once, almost politely, and said, "Then ask the system."

She felt the edge of anger settle into a steady flame. She said, "The check came back. The system says it cannot process it."

He did not meet her eyes. He said, "Something about that report suggests a misread."

There was an ache in that sentence. It sounded less like instruction and more like a prewritten defense.

She saw the first fracture point before she put words to it. He had not denied the anomaly. He had moved the conversation every time she reached an edge. If she wanted anything, she would need another person in the room and a recording from her side of the desk.

He had not asked for those, and she had not offered. She had chosen this room, and in choosing it she had accepted the old trick: the person in power controls what enters the room.

She said, keeping her tone even, "Let us do this properly. Give me the authorization record for redactions and emergency sealing on ORB-1177."

He rubbed his thumb over the edge of the mug. He said, "Only a formal request can make me open those files at this hour."

She asked, "Can you do that?"

He looked at her as she stepped into an argument he had rehearsed but never meant to be asked.

He said, "Any request without process is impossible."

She said, "Then file the process path and I'll start it tomorrow."

A long pause. Somewhere in the corridor behind him, something dropped. Metal on metal. Both listened. The sound vanished before they could identify it.

He gave a narrow nod. He said, "Tomorrow. I'll draft a routing memo. Not for the same reasons you think. You have to understand this is not a personal inquiry."

She wanted to say more, wanted to ask about names, names now, the one who approved, one who requested, one who signed. But the words she heard herself forming were exactly what he wanted from her: a claim he could file and archive.

Instead she said, "Who should I list as the requester for this? Since you won't say names, at least let me know protocol."

He sat back and said, "You'll start at standard oversight."

She asked, "Which office in oversight should I contact?"

He said, "Someone with clearance. Not me."

She said, "Which is to say: not you."

He said, "People rotate. Do not pin it to the wrong person."

She almost asked then: *How convenient*. Instead she stood.

He watched her rise as if this had ended the meeting in his favor.

He said, "This effort to keep your face even is not working."

She said, "I'm focused."

He said, "A practical route can keep you safe if you keep your focus narrow."

She left before the sentence could settle.

Outside the office, the corridor seemed longer than she'd entered it. The floor lights changed with each step, dimming and brightening in shallow intervals. Juno did not mind the game of light. It was easier to walk by rhythm than by certainty.

At the top of the stairwell she checked her slate. The lock icon had been added to the thread. Orin had changed access on her message. He had set the conversation to "restricted review." She almost laughed. So this was the method: ask direct, receive delay, then lock the trail while you wonder whether you had overstepped.

She hit back the command to unlock, then did something he clearly did not expect: she saved a local copy of the segment map and wrote a one-line message to Tamsin in Legal Support, who owed her a favor from last quarter.

> **Need your help. 11 missing + 4 restricted in ORB-1177. I need chain-of-custody for emergency redactions. Not urgent only if there's an official reason; if not, urgent.**

She did not send it yet.

She pressed back and left the box open a second longer, watching the message sit in draft, a little pulse of blue light at the cursor.

At the bridge she reached the observation window and looked out across the city's lower districts. The fog had thickened. A tram moved below, its lights dragging slow gold circles across the streets. The world looked harmless there, as though all the city's systems were built only to deliver milk and books.

Juno put both hands on the glass and breathed once, slowly. The breath came out in cloud and vanished.

She heard a vibration at her belt clip. Not a call from Orin. A system alert from the archive network: **SOMETHING OPENING: LOWER DECK AUTHORITY CONSOLE**. Timestamp exactly one minute after her exit from his office.

She frowned. This could mean nothing. Could mean every routine thing in the building that wakes old doors. Could also mean someone had followed her there, because he knew she had seen too much.

She stood still and watched the status line until it resolved: **No breach detected. Maintenance override active.**

Maintenance. She could have said that phrase by heart now. It meant *something has touched the mechanism without asking for your permission*. It also meant *ask the wrong person and you'll lose your evening*.

She snapped a quick note, date-time stamp included, then turned to leave for home.

The streets were nearly empty when she passed into the outer concourse. She kept her hood low not because it was dark but because she wanted fewer reflections. The building behind her stood quiet, its windows all one expression. Not suspicious. Just tired.

She stopped at the corner kiosk where the old rail station map hung and found a place at the little plastic chair. There, in the weak light, she reread the notes she had taken, this time not in the sharp, tactical hand she used at work but in the slower one she used when she could not sleep. Her handwriting had changed by the second paragraph; by the third it looked almost different, like a confession and an accusation written by two people. She laughed once, bitterly and quietly.

At the bottom of the page she had written in capital letters: **WAS THIS ORDERED?**

She added another line beneath it: **If yes, by whom?**

Then another: **If no, what is being hidden from whom?**

No answers. Just a third question, the practical one, written with less confidence:

**Who benefits if I do not ask again?**

She folded the paper and slid it into her case pocket.

Before she could stand, a maintenance drone zipped above the kiosk with a low beep, pausing above her as if expecting a command. She looked up, annoyed, and then looked down again because some part of her had already accepted that annoyance as a form of surveillance. The drone dipped once and dropped no more than a scrap of printed sheet from a slot beneath its wing.

She caught it reflexively before it hit the pavement.

It was a small card, cream and edged in black, stamped with the Archive crest, and signed with a tiny symbol she recognized from Orin's office shelf--a triple loop and a dot, his private initials, maybe his old sigil or maybe just a printer artifact. On it, in a hand she knew instantly because she had seen it over his shoulder once, was a single line:

> **Do not chase ghosts alone.**

No signature.

No seal.

No department.

Juno held it between thumb and finger until the corner softened against her skin. The line was not a warning. It was instruction. A very specific instruction, and one she recognized as an older kindness: keep away and you still keep being alive.

She did not like the neatness of it.

She had not yet found the person who replaced missing evidence. She had not yet proven deception. She had only the pattern, the quiet refusal, the sealed corridors, and a message from someone who knew precisely what she feared.

She opened her slate and looked once more at Orin's office time stamp. He had changed his door code minutes after the meeting ended.

At that point, if she had believed in grand narratives, she would have said the city itself had chosen one side and shut the door. She did not believe in that any longer. She believed in people who made doors and forgot to lock the frame.

She sent the message to Tamsin after all.

> **I need your office to request chain-of-custody and redaction orders for ORB-1177. I can't clear this through normal review.**

She hit send, then stared at the tiny success pulse.

For one breath, she felt the relief of movement: the momentary sense that she had done something that could not be undone by Orin's refusal. Then a counter-thought came, hard and ordinary: every record request creates a mirror where someone else sees exactly what you can't.

She stood again and started the long walk back to the quarter-line train, keeping her steps measured, counting lampposts the way she used to count train carriages as a child. Twenty-five to the turn, then thirteen to the square, then five more to the station gate.

The train came with its bright belly at the far end of the concourse. She boarded and found a corner seat by the window. Across from her sat a woman with a basket of folded cloth and two sleeping children. The woman had kind eyes and the habit of staring at windows whenever the carriage slowed. It was the kind of scene that almost made Juno cry from exhaustion and then stop before it did.

The station lights flickered as the train lurched forward. Outside, the city unspooled in bands of dark and glow.

Juno took out the folded note from her pocket and smoothed it. The ink had bled at the corner from damp air. She had an irrational thought that if it smudged she might not be able to prove even that someone had warned her. She laughed at herself and put the note inside the inside cover of her journal, where she kept things she wanted to deny later.

She closed her eyes and listened to the train for a while. The wheels made their patient sentence.

She did not sleep. Not because the night was dramatic. But because if she slept before tomorrow's request thread opened, she might lose half the clarity she had by dawn.

When the carriage passed under the river bridge, light pooled up through the slats and crossed her hands like bars. She watched the patterns and thought about the way the building had changed its tone at each floor when she moved down to Orin's office. It was impossible to be certain, impossible to prove, but certain in the same way memory gets certain by repetition: a person who knows where to avoid your questions.

By dawn she was halfway to two different decisions, and both could not be held at once.

First: confront him in public and force a recorded clarification before he had time to build another version.

Second: keep the request quiet, gather one more trace, and go not with accusation but with evidence.

She held both for a while and then made the same choice people make when they have only partial information and no room for heroics. She chose the second.

At home she set the kettle on and forced herself to eat two pieces of bread before she checked her inbox. The message to Tamsin had already moved from sent to seen. No reply yet.

She left it until after tea, then sat in the kitchen with a mug she did not drink from while she drafted her own notes to make the evening coherent. She would not confront alone anymore; she would invite one other person in, someone with clearance and a different set of loyalties. If Orin knew she had done that, it would no longer be easy for him to say it was misunderstanding or routine.

The kettle clicked off. She stood up and went to rinse the mug.

In the small bathroom mirror she saw herself with her own eyes and thought, absurdly, that she still looked like someone making conversation with an archive clerk.

That had been true once. Less now.

She returned to the kitchen and opened her notes. At the top she wrote one line in bigger letters than the rest:

**Confrontation was a check, not a win.**

She turned the line over to this: **Need corroboration before naming deceit.**

Then she drafted a second message to Orin.

> **I'm waiting on your routing memo. I've also initiated an oversight path. If this was a normal redaction event, we can close it quickly. If not, I'd prefer we both know what happened.**

She did not send it.

She left it in draft and sat back. The hour moved without permission. Outside, a delivery drone hummed past the kitchen window, dropping packets into the alley and vanishing before she could see the pilot.

She took out the note again and read the one line. *Do not chase ghosts alone.*

Maybe that was kindness. Maybe warning. Maybe a test.

Either way, she had already left the room in which the first ghost had shown itself. What came next would be better with witnesses.

At first light she dressed and made for the station, keeping her shoulders loose and her hands empty. Tamsin had replied before she left:

> **Understood. Meet me at archive service desk at 10:15. Bring all references and IDs.**

There it was: the smallest door opening.

She looked at the message, then at her notes, then at the city beginning to wake in strips of pale orange beyond the curtain.

Whatever else the day would ask of her, it did not ask for certainty before noon.

And certainty, she had learned from her first confrontation with Orin, was always a luxury for people who never had to open sealed boxes.



She arrived at the service desk to the clatter of morning routine and old coffee scents. Tamsin stood by the counter, sleeves rolled, three files already under one arm. Her expression shifted when Juno approached.

Tamsin said, "Your note was alarming."

Juno replied, "It was incomplete. You can help complete it."

Tamsin held up a hand and said, "Before we begin, I need your exact claims."

Juno handed over a printed copy of the manifest she had marked. Tamsin scanned the columns and whistled softly, more for herself than for performance. She said, "Eleven missing, four restricted. You're certain?"

Orin had once said in one of those moments when he used the city as weather. If Juno had been in the hearing room, she shook her head at the memory. Juno said, "I'm certain enough to have trouble sleeping."

Tamsin said, "Good. Trouble sleep is usually the first check mark."

They went behind the rear partition where private requests were filed, and Tamsin asked for exact references.

Juno read off each segment. She named the hour. She named the marker codes. She named the duplicate checksum from ORB-1132 and the missing windows. She said "emergency protocol" and "system propagation" while they were both acceptable and unacceptable in one breath. Tamsin did not interrupt, which made each word stand more alone.

When she finished, Tamsin nodded toward a keyboard and said, "I'm logging this as a review escalation. It will be marked for chain verification."

Juno exhaled once in relief and then caught herself. Relief was an old trick. She was not asking for absolution.

Juno asked, "What do I do now?"

Tamsin said, "Now. You wait. And do nothing that gives Orin a clean rebuttal."

That was almost funny and almost cruel. Juno almost laughed in spite of herself.

Outside the partition the building seemed unchanged: same lights, same polished stairwell, same people with coffee and patience. Only her satchel felt heavier.

She asked Tamsin if she needed the names of any officials. Tamsin gave her the first rule of their work: "Never ask names too soon. Ask for signatures first."

And that, too, sounded like a warning wrapped around a map.

Juno returned to the rail platform with the request number now stamped into her pocket note. Above her, the public screens flashed route changes. The world could move on without waiting for her to prove anything.

At the far end of the platform, a train announced itself in three tones. She boarded and stood near the door, where commuters would not ask too many questions.

At ten past ten, the message window on her slate buzzed.

> **From: Orin**
> **To: Juno**
> **Subject: Routing memo available**
>
> Reviewed your concerns. Routing memo logged. Please file through proper channels now as advised.
>
Just like that. No details.

She saved it and typed back only one line:

> **Under review.**

No one would call that a victory.

She looked at the line and then looked at the city again, moving past in glass and stone and people she did not know.

She could still see in her mind Orin's face when he had said, *Trust the noise*. He had sounded like a man trying to make a principle into mercy.

Now she looked at the train map projected overhead and knew he had just given her a map too, but with the edges blank.

Back in her own desk, after hours of routine tasks and forms that gave no answer, she finally opened a fresh file and wrote the summary report for herself. Not for him, not for legal, not for drama. For the part of her that needed to see the line from now on.

She wrote:

- Missing segments are consistent across mirrored systems.
- Restrictions are marked without chain annotation.
- Emergency redaction explanation was non-specific and unsupported in-session.
- Response from Orin: procedural deflection and lock-down of communication thread.
- Next action: request filed with oversight and legal support.

She underlined the final line.

She did not yet have deception. But she had enough pattern to make a lie look tired.

She closed the file and looked up at the door of Orin's wing on her screen map. In her mind, someone might have just changed the locks again. She felt again the odd sensation that had marked every useful suspicion: anger mixed with relief.

Anger, because someone had already begun to shape truth.

Relief, because she had not gone in blind.

That felt like progress in a world where every certainty came with a tax.

When evening returned, and the building lights moved from day-brightness to night-gauge, Juno still had not resolved anything. That was true. But she had also done what she needed: she had found the missing pieces, named them with precision, and handled Orin's practiced detour without giving him the clean victory of being wrong and angry.

At dusk she stood once more at the corridor where it had begun and let the quiet sit. She was still, and the room answered with small sounds: fans, cooling pipes, someone's whispered laugh through the far office wall.

She opened the manifest and saw the same line at the top.

*RESTRICTED ACCESS GRANTED.*

She put down a pencil and waited.

Tomorrow the file would move out of her desk and into something larger. Tomorrow there would be formal tags, formal signatures, formal denials, maybe formal consequences.

Tonight there were only questions that did not close.

And if Orin had hoped she would be satisfied by his deflection, he had underestimated the speed with which one person could choose, quietly, not to stop.

In a place built to record everything, it was not always the loudest voices that changed history.

Sometimes it was the person who kept every missing minute in view.


She wrote one final sentence before leaving and closed the chapter of the day:

**He had not answered her yet, because he could still afford not to. But he had given her enough of a refusal to know where to push next.**
