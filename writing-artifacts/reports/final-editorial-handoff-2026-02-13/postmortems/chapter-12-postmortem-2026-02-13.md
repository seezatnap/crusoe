## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,582 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Shifts perspective architecture to Sable’s context and raises the constraint mechanism from rumor to lived design choice. | Ensure chapter-13 references this discovery as an actionable constraint framework. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Sable perspective and infrastructure language align with Act-3 setup in specs; no timeline inversion or lore contradiction observed. | Keep technical terminology consistent with this chapter’s definitions of drift, restraint, and continuity. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No repeat-blocking cliche detections in quality run. | Continue targeted read for phrase-level variety in future drafts. | Writing QA | 2026-02-25 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Dialogue remains scene-driven and mostly tagged enough for comprehension; no blocker-level issues in latest quality run. | Keep the present-tense witness framing legible in later scenes. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Effective alternation between analytical reveal and procedural tension, with a clear emotional midpoint. | Preserve this turn into Act-3 confrontation in chapter-13. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Historical-grounded scenes retain sensory weight without diluting present-line abstraction. | Keep physical-detail anchors in any inserted explanatory lines. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | New mechanism revelations stay within known canon constraints and do not add unsupported world claims. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Revelation logic deepens from symptom (obscured records) to system-level explanation (architectural constraint lineage).
- Antagonist evolution support is indirect but important: Orin’s actions feel more coercive from this point because the information he suppresses has design ancestry.
- Ethical stakes are explicit and coherent: exposure is framed as a burden of governance, with witnesses and continuity obligations beginning to surface.
