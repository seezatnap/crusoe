## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,381 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Juno moves from passive compliance to rogue access behavior, and the chapter clearly escalates the Act 3 "forbidden knowledge" arc. | Carry this unresolved risk into chapter-12 as direct consequence (system response pressure increases). | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Orin remains positioned as sanctioned Curator but increasingly instrumental in restriction escalation; timeline and character relationships match chapter-10 end-state. | Keep this framing stable when resolving chapter 11→12 handoff. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Cliches | WARN | One blocker pattern remains: repeated phrase "as if" (9+ repeats in current analyzer thresholds). | Remove or refocus at least 3 of the highest-frequency instances in the next draft pass. | Writing QA | 2026-02-21 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | No new blocker-level findings introduced by this pass; existing dialogue rhythm remains legible. | Continue running line-level tagging audit when voice model changes in later cleanup. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Clear setup (quiet warning), escalation (rogue deep-jump decision), and midpoint consequence (public-risk framing). | Preserve this rhythm in chapter-12’s transition beat. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-Lattice abstraction and present-tense ethical pressure remain consistent; no abrupt tone fracture introduced. | Maintain contrast in scene texture near the final disclosure transition. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore boundary breach detected; revelation constraints stay at Act-3 depth and remain tied to Orin’s governance posture. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Revelation logic now lands on an ethical decision point: Juno accepts risk with motive clarity rather than shock-driven curiosity.
- Antagonist evolution is coherent in this chapter: Orin appears less as administrator and more as a protective gatekeeper actively shaping access outcomes.
- Stakes are ethically aligned: the chapter frames disclosure as a cost-bearing civic question, not a pure power grab.
