## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,650 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Chapter moves to repeated Sable evidence and social pressure on Juno while keeping Orin as a structural actor, matching Act-2 momentum. | Preserve escalation point where personal strain starts shaping investigative choice. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Continuity | PASS | Matches #6 row 06 (Sable motif as recurring pattern and architectural pressure). Aligns #5 row 06–07 development arc. | None. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | `cliche-detection` reported zero findings; no blockers. | Keep phrase variety in later scene transitions. | Writing QA | 2026-02-18 |
| Dialogue Realism | WARN | `voice-consistency` reports indicate POV and attribution warnings; no blocker in this chapter at current threshold. | Resolve ambiguous dialogue attribution / speaker continuity in future pass. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Pacing | PASS | Layer transitions and mid-chapter pressure points remain clear; escalation remains gradual but cumulative. | Avoid flattening scene rhythm near conference-room segment. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present scenes show emotional withdrawal and pressure; recording scenes retain sensory detail and operational texture. | Keep contrast clear between Lattice pressure and recording intimacy. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore contradiction introduced; revelations stay within previously established Sable-as-architecture logic. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: acceptable alternation between present-lattice and recording layers, with transitions triggered by investigation beats.
- Act-level escalation: progression is sustained rather than abrupt; increases social and epistemic risk without skipping consequence.
- Continuity with #6/#5: good continuity with #6 row 06 and #5 sequencing through 2033–2034 technical pressure.

## Final Gate Decision
