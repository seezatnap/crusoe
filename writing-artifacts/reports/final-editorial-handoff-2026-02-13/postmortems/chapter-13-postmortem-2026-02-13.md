## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,937 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Increases immediate pressure on Juno via direct confrontation and constrained-release logic; clearly advances to decisive ethical confrontation before chapter-14 confession. | Keep chapter-13 ending as a direct bridge to Maren’s full answer in chapter-14. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Orin’s role as active suppressor and curator enforcer is now materially stronger than in chapter-12. | Preserve this escalation tone and avoid collapsing him into caricature in later scenes. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No blocker findings in latest run. | Continue lexical sweep across next edit cycle. | - | - |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Dialogue still reads as conflict-scored and consequence-bearing rather than purely expository. | Watch attribution density when new witness scenes are inserted. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Escalation curve is strong: ideological clash, moral argument, procedural threat, then setup for final parent-secret transfer. | Preserve the midpoint turn and exit tension for chapter-14. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-Lattice register remains consistent while technical debates move cleanly into concrete risk terms. | Keep transitions to direct emotional line markers (Maren, witness, confession) explicit. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | Mechanistic claims about architecture, drift, and secrecy remain anchored to established lore. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Revelation logic benefits from the two added revision lines: the "memory from one more responsible decision" phrase and explicit burden framing before the full admission arc.
- Antagonist evolution is now explicit: Orin shifts from gatekeeping to policy-hardening in service of preventive suppression.
- Ethical stakes alignment is strongest in this chapter: chapter-level moral argument now frames civilizational safety as a tradeoff, not a pretext for permanent secrecy.
