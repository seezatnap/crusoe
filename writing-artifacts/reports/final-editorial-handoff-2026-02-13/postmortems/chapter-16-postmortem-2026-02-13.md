## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,739 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Chapter-16 translates the third option into public execution and resistance, and creates measurable civic engagement before stabilization. | Keep final lines of chapter-17 explicit about unresolved district outcomes as the next forward vector. | Agent Aaron | 2026-02-20 |
| Continuity | PASS | Public disclosure mechanics in this chapter follow Chapter-15’s witness policy and extend Orin/Cassiel/Fen roles without contradiction. | Preserve the sequence: release → countermeasures → signatures → public queue expansion. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No cliche blockers in latest run. | Maintain practical language over abstract declarative language in expanded public scenes. | Writing QA | 2026-02-26 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Scenes remain conflict-driven; emotional beats stay tied to policy consequence and immediate human response. | Keep dialogue tied to one concrete operational question per exchange. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Good chapter energy curve: opening wave, escalating resistance, practical workarounds, witness signatures, open phase window. | Preserve the “exhaustion + forward motion” rhythm in any future trims. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-Lattice civic register remains coherent and matches Act-4 thematic intent. | Keep the chapter-level tension in public consequence, not speculative melodrama. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No unsupported lore expansion; policy actions remain within established governance and witness architecture. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Ending coherence is strong: chapter-16 closes with a first round of witness signatures and explicit unresolved outcomes, which avoids fake finality and sets up chapter-17’s societal implementation pass.
- Emotional closure is partial and appropriate for this chapter (majority uncertainty still unresolved, but clear movement toward collective process).
- Open-thread posture is explicit: resistance, delayed consensus, and open technical questions are intentionally left active.

## Validation Note

- Full quality session run for this chapter now uses `quality-orchestrator-1771016923.md` (targeting `final-draft-chapters/chapter-16.md`) and fails at error threshold (`status: failed`, total findings: 124, 1 blocking report). Previous stale report `quality-orchestrator-1771014239.md` (pre-fix, 143 findings) was removed.

## Final Gate Decision

`PASS`
