## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,055 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Chapter-17 resolves Act-4 execution into practical outcomes (district-level divergence, partial reductions, no panic outcomes) and carries forward the register for phase-2 adaptation. | Keep one explicit forward-reference hook to unresolved physical-world/lore questions in the final sequence for next-cycle continuity. | Agent Aaron | 2026-02-23 |
| Continuity | PASS | Final Maren visit and public roll-forward behavior follow established grief/legacy motifs and do not contradict chapter-16’s witness process. | Preserve the mixed-results map in unresolved outcomes to avoid narrative flattening. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No cliche blocker findings in latest run. | Maintain the restrained register in closing emotional scenes. | - | - |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Major emotional exchanges remain consequence-focused and scene-specific; non-dialogue register remains strong in public-procedural passages. | Keep concise attribution in remaining back-and-forth to support pace. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Strongly staged finale: morning uncertainty → district outcomes → final Maren closure → phase-2 governance note. | Preserve the final calm-as-labor ending, avoid adding abrupt “final answer” beat. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Consistent present-Lattice tone (procedural + intimate grief cadence) with a controlled emotional descent and no tonal collapse. | Keep this chapter ending sparse so the final world-building implication remains open. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No unsupported lore additions. Mixed-choice outcomes and monitoring procedures are consistent with prior architecture rules. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Ending coherence is intentionally non-triumphal: no full resolution, but a stable baseline for choice under witness oversight.
- Emotional closure is achieved through farewell logic: Juno accepts partial knowledge, carries grief forward, and re-commits to public work.
- Open-thread posture is healthy: unresolved civic trajectories remain explicit through district-level divergence and phase-2 language.
