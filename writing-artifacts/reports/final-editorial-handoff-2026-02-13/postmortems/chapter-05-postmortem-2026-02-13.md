## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,828 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Presents present-layer impact on archive strategy plus two escalation points: Sable pattern recognition and ethical cost of Juno’s continuing involvement. | Keep these transitions as explicit handoff to chapter-06’s deeper pattern loop. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Continuity | PASS | Matches #6 matrix for chapter-05 as early sustainment of Act-2 arc: ethical strain in present behavior tied to recording findings. Aligns #5 row 05 (first sustained Engram arc and ethical strain). | None. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No `CLIC` blocker; repeated phrase density is below threshold after revision. | Keep anti-cliché scans active in chapter-06 handoff. | Writing QA | 2026-02-18 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Dialogue remains character-forward; no new structural blockages. | Spot-check tags in future present scenes. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-18 |
| Pacing | PASS | Clear opening in present, recording escalation, and present consequence layer. Midpoint scene turns to concrete ethical pressure. | Maintain this alternation in next draft. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-Lattice abstraction remains controlled; recording layers maintain sensory anchoring. Transition points are motivated by investigation milestones. | Preserve this same alternation into chapter-09/10. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore-rule violation introduced; reveals stay within established continuity and pre-#10 knowledge budget. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: cleanly handled through marker-led alternation from present to recording; no abrupt register collapse.
- Act-level escalation: this chapter raises pressure by moving Juno from observation into sustained ethical burden; prepares the first sustained present social cost.
- Continuity with #6/#5: strong alignment with #6 row 05 and #5 timeline row for 2031–2033 development milestones.
