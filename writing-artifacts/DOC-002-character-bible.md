# Character Bible — *On the Fall of Dr. Joe*

## Core Principle
This document defines every named character established in the foundational phase. Treat it as a source-of-truth for first-pass chapter drafts. Any new named character introduced later must have an entry added here before prose appears.

## Character Roster

## Dr. Joseph "Joe" Hale
- **Role**: Victim; municipal physician and experimental researcher at Saint Jude’s Infirmary.
- **Backstory**: Third-generation Halewell physician educated in Glasgow before returning to Brackwater in 1929. Joe built a reputation for difficult cases and wartime casualty triage, which taught him to keep strict emotional distance in public. His marriage into local respectability gave him access to Brackwater’s elite, but also to their private leverage.
- **Motivation**: Preserve civic reputation and protect patients from institutional collapse after uncovering billing and treatment irregularities involving prominent families.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Margaret Hale** (wife): outwardly loyal partnership, privately strained by financial secrecy.
  - **Evelyn Hale** (daughter): affectionate but distant, because she once discovered that her mother and father both feared his wartime experiments.
  - **Inspector Celia Pencombe** (investigating): professional respect mixed with defensive caution.
  - **Clara Bell (housekeeper)**: trusted steward with silent loyalty and dangerous knowledge.
- **Speech pattern**: Controlled, medical cadence; avoids emotional words, favors precise nouns (“hemorrhage,” “contamination,” “sequence”).
- **Secrets**:
  - Maintained a private ledger of patients who paid off hospital supply shortages through unofficial channels.
  - Stored correspondence with a military physician regarding a sedative trial that could expose him if published.
  - Kept a duplicate key to Saint Jude’s records closet hidden in a false tooth filling case.
- **POV behavior**: Use spare, observant internal narration with short sensory anchors (metals, antiseptic, rain), and moments of refusal before disclosure. His POV is analytical, often translating social scenes into risk assessments.

## Margaret Hale
- **Role**: Joe’s wife and first public face of the family; social pillar in Brackwater.
- **Backstory**: Former governess who became Margaret Brackenley through marriage into the Hale family. Learned etiquette and influence through decades of charitable committees and wartime relief work.
- **Motivation**: Keep the Hale name intact and maintain the material structure her family depends on, even at moral cost.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Joe Hale**: marriage of utility and genuine regard, destabilized by secrets and class pressure.
  - **Evelyn Hale**: protective mother who manages their daughter’s movements publicly while resenting her need for independence.
  - **Gideon Bracken**: attorney and family adviser; old ally and possibly overconfident manipulator.
  - **Inspector Pencombe**: keeps formal respect for law while quietly trying to shape the investigation’s narrative.
- **Speech pattern**: Proper, ceremonial phrasing; inserts proverb-like moral maxims and churchyard calm. She pauses before answering direct questions.
- **Secrets**:
  - Drew money from a private reserve meant for Joseph’s clinic, with permission no longer valid after her husband’s death.
  - Knows who gave Joe the key to the old records closet.
  - Has evidence Joe intended to change his will, but has not disclosed it.
- **POV behavior**: Use socially strategic narration: she observes who is listening before she reveals anything. Inner monologue is dominated by consequence-mapping.

## Evelyn Hale
- **Role**: Joe and Margaret’s daughter, age 21, frequent presence at the Glass Lantern Theater.
- **Backstory**: Raised with strict propriety, she spent the war years tutoring children of dock foremen and mechanics. She learned practical competence and contempt for performative respectability.
- **Motivation**: Seek autonomy from family obligations and determine whether her father’s legacy is a shield or a cage.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Joe Hale**: adored him as a boyhood hero, now suspicious of his silence.
  - **Margaret**: love mixed with resentment over surveillance and control.
  - **Maeve Quinn (telegraph operator)**: close friend who provides street-level intelligence about the city.
  - **Inspector Pencombe**: potential ally in moments when truth is presented bluntly.
- **Speech pattern**: Rapid, direct, and occasionally impish; uses theatrical metaphors when nervous.
- **Secrets**:
  - Attended private sessions with Father Pike’s social reform circle, where Joe’s treatment records were discussed.
  - Kept one copy of correspondence related to her father’s anti-scandal strategy.
- **POV behavior**: POV should be mobile, emotionally reactive, and slightly iconoclastic. She notices social performances first and lets doubt shape her conclusions.

## Inspector Celia Pencombe
- **Role**: Lead investigator from Mire Street Station House.
- **Backstory**: Former wartime military clerk who joined civilian police after losing family members in the same week as the 1926 dock strike. Known for disciplined evidence work and unusually high civic trust.
- **Motivation**: Recover truth without yielding to social pressure, then use the case to prove disciplined policing can survive old class influence.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Sergeant Thomas Vale**: loyal partner, trusted for calm execution of field tasks.
  - **Inspector-in-Chief Hargreaves**: mentors her but expects speed more than elegance.
  - **Margaret Hale**: respectful distance, because social power can distort testimony.
  - **Joe Hale**: respects his competence and suspects his records are key to motive architecture.
- **Speech pattern**: Crisp, practical, clause-driven. Frequently begins with procedural framing (“At this stage…”), then narrows to a single actionable hypothesis.
- **Secrets**:
  - Keeps personal notes in a coded field book to protect witnesses who speak off-record.
  - Has a pre-existing debt to the Halewell family for helping her brother during wartime illness.
- **POV behavior**: Narration should remain externally grounded: concrete observations, timeline checks, and refusal of speculation unless evidence permits. Strong self-regulation: she notices herself doing this and documents it.

## Sergeant Thomas Vale
- **Role**: Pencombe’s field lead; bridges witness interviews and forensic logistics.
- **Backstory**: Dockworker’s son with formal police training and a practical, physically oriented investigative style. Rose through postings that rewarded reliability.

- **Secrets**:
  - Accepted an unofficial ride from a dock supervisor during one storm, creating a timeline ambiguity he never disclosed.
  - Knows the names of two regular falsifiers in municipal key-copy registries.
- **POV behavior**: POV is kinetic and immediate: he reads space as much as speech. Uses tactile details (mud, rope, damp wool, ink, breath fog) and trusts what can be touched.

## Clara Bell
- **Role**: Senior housekeeper at Hallowford House; controls domestic routines and quiet room access.
- **Backstory**: Former boarding-house matron from the Harbor Ward who built the Hale household habits after her mother’s death; known for absolute punctuality and memory for who entered by which door.

  - **Joe Hale**: employer and protector, but she mistrusts his nighttime work at Saint Jude’s.
  - **Margaret Hale**: careful respect, occasional conflict over staff decisions.
  - **Evelyn Hale**: affectionate, mentoring but occasionally withholding.

- **Secrets**:
  - Saw an unidentified visitor on the storm-night using a duplicate house key.
  - Logged an inventory change in her own notebook that does not match staff records.
- **POV behavior**: Internal POV is procedural and sensory. She notices routines, objects, and absences; her narrations should include sequence of chores and what changed physically.

## Gideon Bracken
- **Role**: Family solicitor representing the Halewell estates and municipal trusts.
- **Backstory**: Son of a shipping accountant, educated in law to escape dock poverty. Became Joe’s legal advisor after the Great Depression when clinic liabilities began to mount.

- **Secrets**:
  - Drafted an unsigned amendment limiting disclosure rights to one of Joe’s trial participants.
  - Knows the source of one black-market medicine delivery used to cover shortfalls.
- **POV behavior**: In POV, Gideon thinks in contingencies and outcomes; he frames truth as something to be protected by sequencing. He avoids emotive adjectives.

## Lionel Bracken
- **Role**: Joe’s childhood peer and distant cousin; manages dock ledger work for Brackwater cargo houses.
- **Backstory**: Grew up in Narrow Harbor with mixed resentments toward the social rise of the Hale household. Efficient with shipping manifests and route delays.

- **Relationships**:
  - **Gideon Bracken**: family loyalty but long-standing disagreement over legal exposure.
  - **Joseph Hale**: mixture of indebtedness and grievance.
  - **Samuel Pike (dock foreman)**: practical ally with shared knowledge of manifest irregularities.

- **Secrets**:
  - Altered one dock manifest linked to medical shipment timing.
  - Borrowed a family key set through a second-hand locksmith during a strike blackout.

## Samuel Pike
- **Role**: Dock foreman at Tallow Wharf and intermediary between warehouses, clerks, and river transport.
- **Backstory**: Built reputation for hard logistics management during difficult weather windows. Became indispensable because he could move sensitive cargo without delays.
- **Motivation**: Keep Tallow Wharf functioning and keep his crew off the payroll blacklists.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Lionel Bracken**: frequent collaborator and occasional rival.
  - **Inspector Pencombe**: practical informant when pressured.
  - **Josephine Granger**: trusted source of gossip because she pays with details, not money.
- **Speech pattern**: Grounded, sea-laced idiom. Frequently references weather windows, tides, and load capacities.
- **Secrets**:
  - Received sealed boxes marked for private municipal delivery at least twice before official paperwork.
  - Helped hide an overnight cargo exchange near Old Observatory Lane.
- **POV behavior**: Sensory, body-first, spatial POV. He trusts clocks, weather, and witness patterns; emotional revelations come through clenched jaw and body orientation.

## Josephine Granger
- **Role**: Reporter for the Brackwater Gazette, covering local civic and health matters.
- **Backstory**: Former telegraph typist who moved into reporting after exposing a council procurement failure. She is known as fair but merciless on inconsistencies.
- **Motivation**: Publish the story that protects ordinary Brackwater families from elite manipulation and proves her independence from political interests.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Inspector Pencombe**: professional tension over public leaks.
  - **Sergeant Vale**: periodic rivalry over factual lead time.
  - **Evelyn Hale**: source of social intelligence.
- **Speech pattern**: Fast, declarative, headline-like. She favors short sentences and rhetorical punctuation (“No one will remember,” “The numbers say otherwise”).
- **Secrets**:
  - Possesses a photograph of an unidentified visitor entering Hallowford House on the night of the death.
  - Received partial advance payment from a city office sponsor for “neutral” coverage.
- **POV behavior**: POV should be outward-facing, deadline-sensitive, and skeptical. She reads contradiction as evidence and rarely internalizes emotion before publication decisions.

## Maeve Quinn
- **Role**: Senior telegraph operator at Mire Street Station House and informal information relay for the neighborhood.
- **Backstory**: Learned to handle emergency comms before she finished school, known for memory and speed. Keeps relationships across class lines because everyone needs quick lines relayed on fog nights.

- **Relationships**:
  - **Inspector Pencombe**: respected functionary and occasional confidante in late shifts.
  - **Evelyn Hale**: close friend and emotional sounding board.
  - **Joseph Granger**: ex-fiancé, now a silent ally in cross-checking shipping routes.

- **Secrets**:
  - Delayed one emergency relay at the start of the storm window after being instructed privately by an unknown caller.
  - Stored duplicate copies of outgoing telegram drafts for fear someone would delete inconvenient records.

## Reverend Simon Pike
- **Role**: Curate attached to Brackwater parish and informal counselor to several households.
- **Backstory**: Quietly educated in London theology with a long practice in post-loss counselling. Known for practical charity and discretion with shame.

- **Relationships**:
  - **Joe Hale**: moral ally in earlier years, now a source of difficult unresolved ethical questions.
  - **Margaret Hale**: confidant in family stress and public optics.
  - **Evelyn Hale**: supportive adult counsel figure, though he avoids direct police involvement.
- **Speech pattern**: Slow, cadenced, sermon-like with biblical phrasing when cornered.
- **Secrets**:
  - Mediated confidential admissions about treatment funding under oath of charity but not official confidentiality law.
  - Received one admission from Joe that a patient’s death could have been prevented with delayed information he was unsure when to expose.
- **POV behavior**: POV should be meditative and ethically framed. He reasons through moral consequence before fact, and narrations include conscience-language and pauses between decisions.

## Cross-Character Guardrails
- For any character with a medical or investigative role, keep dialogue grounded in 1938 vocabulary and avoid modern terminology.
- Any scene with a character’s secrets should include at least one external corroboration point (record, witness, object, or time marker).
- Speech patterns must remain stable across chapters: keep rhythm, diction, and register differences visible.
- POV shifts should stay physically plausible: people are more honest in habits (timing, objects, and logistics) than in declarations.
