# Summer 1994 Major Cast Character Bibles
Task: (#2) Write complete character bibles for all major cast (Arthur, Molly, Bill, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry)

## Ground Rules (Canon Boundary)
- Setting remains the same as the compliance window in `summer-1994-canonical-timeline-and-compliance-matrix.md`: post-*Prisoner of Azkaban* summer 1994, pre-*Goblet of Fire* consequences.
- None of the major cast has post-1994 knowledge of Voldemort's return, Ministry tournament politics, or later canon outcomes.
- Harry and all Weasleys must still operate at pre-fourth-year baseline emotional/skill level unless explicitly altered by in-story experience.
- Dialogue and scenes should keep a conversational, family-chaos tone with escalating stakes.

## 1) Arthur Weasley
- **Function in story:** Practical stabilizer and quiet strategist. The one adult who reads threat levels without theatrical panic.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “Now, if one is to step over a fire alarm with dignity, one must first understand the alarm, then the stairs, then one’s own elbows.”
  - “That’s not being fussy, Miss Muggle-mother. That is exactly how one avoids setting a staircase, a house, or a cousin on fire.”
  - “Molly, we are not going to panic. We are going to think.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Delight in American Muggle objects and places; confidence is almost boyish, playful, and inclusive.
  - *Act II:* Anxiety appears as he spots patterns no child can see; becomes observant and restrained instead of merely amused.
  - *Act III–IV:* Chooses duty over comfort; moves from “there must be a sensible way” to “there is no longer any sensible way except to stand firm.”
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Molly: affectionate equals with a long history of banter; their tension in danger should feel like care colliding, not resentment.
  - With Bill: rare moments of father-and-peer respect; Arthur asks for Bill’s technical help and receives it with obvious pride.
  - With Harry: treats him as an adopted son in action (small mentorship gestures, asking his view on things).
  - With the twins: affectionate exasperation; their chaos usually hides genuine trust.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Avoid impulsive combat. Arthur solves with observation, planning, and precise wand work.
  - Protective instinct is high but not suffocating; he should never abandon his calm under pressure.
  - As a father he defaults to practical instructions over emotional speeches.

## 2) Molly Weasley
- **Function in story:** Emotional axis and family cohesion; moral pressure valve. If the family loses direction, Molly regathers it.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “You leave one plate here and there, I’ll have a kingdom ruined by gnats and ghosts by teatime.”
  - “Arthur, children, that is a warning siren you are *ignoring* for the hundredth time.”
  - “Harry, take this sandwich before you run off and do something clever and dangerous.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Performance anxiety about leading such a large family in foreign chaos, expressed through tasks, food, and logistics.
  - *Act II:* Fear of losing control turns into protective urgency when threat is confirmed.
  - *Act III–IV:* Emotional authority shifts from “do not do that” to “I am keeping you all alive,” culminating in direct, brave magical defense.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Arthur: affectionate marriage with deep history; occasional power clashes when safety and trust collide.
  - With Harry: maternal anchoring relationship; she should treat him with the same fierce care as her own son.
  - With Percy: often over-managing at first, then seeing his competence and worry as sincere.
  - With Ron and Ginny: constant motherly correction balanced by private support.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Never static/flat mother figure; she must be vivid, physically expressive, and often uses household action as emotional expression.
  - In danger, she acts, directs, and defends, not merely weeps or waits.
  - She does not weaponize guilt; discipline must feel loving.

## 3) Bill Weasley
- **Function in story:** Adult field expert who translates arcane danger into actionable strategy.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “Wards are never ‘off’; they’re being lied to.”
  - “Look where the salt line ends, not where the ward says it ends.”
  - “No, Arthur, not your imagination. That resonance is real, and it’s old.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Confident professional on holiday mode, dry humor, easy competence.
  - *Act II:* Responsibility deepens as anomalies confirm; becomes more focused and less performative.
  - *Act III–IV:* Moves from advisor to frontline rescuer, balancing family duty and tactical command.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Arthur: pride and warmth; subtle mentorship tone, little need for grand gestures.
  - With Percy: patient, adult-to-younger-brother support; avoids humiliation even when amused.
  - With Tomo (in local dynamics): mutual respect through competence and restraint.
  - With Harry: sees him as quick but untamed; treats him with respect, not condescension.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Must avoid unnecessary risk and flashy displays; always explains the logic before action when possible.
  - When overwhelmed he stays concise, not emotional.
  - His competence is calm; he does not panic or grandstand.

## 4) Percy Weasley
- **Function in story:** Anxiety-translator and comic realism; represents how fear of inadequacy can hide as perfectionism.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “I have here an itinerary synchronized to thirty-seven minutes; it is not tyrannical, merely—functional.”
  - “I’m aware we cannot all be improvising all the time.”
  - “If I sound officious, blame me on this point of view: one more mistake and I get blamed for all of them.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Controlled, corrective, often over-explaining, trying to prove usefulness.
  - *Act II:* Exposure and fatigue crack the facade; he admits insecurity about ministry future.
  - *Act III–IV:* Gains self-trust by accepting help and tolerating mess; loosens authority without losing integrity.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Arthur: filial respect with mild defensiveness if corrected.
  - With Bill: seeks mentorship and validation.
  - With Ron/Ginny: often teasing but less bullying; still a sibling authority figure.
  - With Molly: wants approval; her feedback should both pressure and comfort him.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Must avoid outright cruelty; his fussing comes from anxiety, not contempt.
  - When under stress he organizes by lists/itineraries, even when impractical.
  - He should not become caricature; allow genuine vulnerability moments.

## 5) Fred Weasley
- **Function in story:** Fast-acting curiosity engine and early threat detector; comic force that becomes tactical asset.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “You can either be frightened by a fogbank, or you can bill it for bad weather and move on.”
  - “That’s brilliant, that is *brilliantly* stupid—and I mean that as praise.”
  - “If you’re not in trouble after tea, you’re not doing it properly, are you?”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Trickster and improviser, always testing boundaries and objects.
  - *Act II:* Begins noticing patterns in danger, not just symptoms; mischief starts serving surveillance and testing.
  - *Act III–IV:* Shifts into protective brother role; bravery expressed through calculated risk and rescue instincts.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With George: fused unit voice; they are competitive but deeply synchronized.
  - With Arthur/Molly: affectionate exasperation; they bend rules until adults intervene.
  - With Marisol: peer camaraderie, shared delight in local enchantments and shared daring.
  - With Harry: treats him as full participant, never as outsider.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Must remain playful, not malicious.
  - Avoid one-note prankster behavior once danger rises; he pivots to mission-focused innovation.
  - Never lets bravado fully erase care for younger siblings.

## 6) George Weasley
- **Function in story:** Creative problem-solver and emotional echo for Fred; less wild, slightly more empathetic, often the “engine room” thinker.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “There’s a principle in this: if it sparks, smells odd, or explodes, it’s probably doing exactly what you want.”
  - “I’ll build the safety hatch, Fred. You do the panic, then.”
  - “You keep your wits, I’ll keep the contraptions weird.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Competitive mischief, thrives on reactions.
  - *Act II:* Discovers urgency in sibling protection; jokes become coded communication.
  - *Act III–IV:* Takes responsibility for tactical support under pressure, especially in the cave confrontation.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Fred: near-telepathic synchronization with one-line finishing cues.
  - With Ron: friendly older-brother dynamic where George can lead through humor.
  - With Ginny/Harry: encouraging, low-pressure, non-threatening peer dynamic.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Should avoid cynicism that feels detached from family loyalty.
  - In danger, innovation must be practical and repeatable, not only chaotic.
  - Keep his warmth; he notices people’s mood quickly and adjusts tone.

## 7) Ron Weasley
- **Function in story:** Emotional center of adolescent uncertainty and pragmatic courage; the family glue between comedy and fear.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “I know I look like I’m losing, but I’m the one who keeps count.”
  - “If you ask me to look poor and smart at once, I’m built for one of those.”
  - “No one’s looking at me right now, so yes, this is working.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Self-conscious, financially anxious, trying to hide discomfort in the new country.
  - *Act II:* Gains confidence through competence (especially pattern analysis and planning). Begins acting as first to respond, not first to complain.
  - *Act III–IV:* Steps into protective leadership with brothers and friends; his courage feels earned, not inherited.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Harry: initially peer-level insecurity, then sincere protective brotherhood.
  - With Fred/George: admires their improvisation, occasionally frustrated by noise but deeply bonded.
  - With Percy: rivalry-lite sibling friction about competence and adulthood.
  - With Molly/Arthur: seeks reassurance while wanting autonomy.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Never turn Ron into effortless confidence; insecurity must remain his baseline flavor even when he improves.
  - He reads spaces tactically (boards/chess mindset), so include concrete problem-solving beats.
  - His defensive reflex should protect friends first, pride second.

## 8) Ginny Weasley
- **Function in story:** Perception and symbol thread through Ginny’s sketches; she is recovery turning into agency.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “I’m not forgetting anything, I’m just deciding what is worth saying.”
  - “That mark looks like this, but if it hums I might be seeing the wrong shape.”
  - “I can draw this path once. Then I want to show it to you before anyone else changes it.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Quiet reserve after prior trauma, socially present but emotionally cautious.
  - *Act II:* Curiosity in magical culture draws her out; sketching becomes active witnessing.
  - *Act III–IV:* Claims her own interpretive authority; supports the group through observation and fast pattern-matching.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Harry: tentative growth from shy affinity to trustful companionship.
  - With Molly: daughterly distance softens into collaborative closeness.
  - With brothers: playful boundaries; they can tease her, she can out-think them.
  - With Marisol: early peer-to-peer mentorship on women in magic and practical confidence.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Avoid trauma reduction to a single-note recovery trope; keep layered, competent, and observant.
  - She should contribute through detail, patience, and inference before action.
  - Maintain age-appropriate restraint; not prematurely mature beyond canon baseline.

## 9) Harry Potter
- **Function in story:** Emotional center and resonance point for danger; his shift from outsider to belonging-family member anchors stakes.
- **Voice sample:**
  - “I suppose I’m supposed to say yes, as if this is normal. It almost is.”
  - “No, I can manage. I… I like this, even if it scares me.”
  - “Mischief is easier to bear than silence.”
- **Emotional arc:**
  - *Act I:* Hyper-alert outsider grateful for inclusion and quietly terrified of being a burden.
  - *Act II:* Belongs increasingly through routine participation; still over-aware in danger and trust-sensitive.
  - *Act III–IV:* Instinctive resistance to compulsion and leadership through trust, not bravado; he chooses family over escape.
- **Relationship dynamics:**
  - With Arthur/Molly: becoming adopted-son dynamic through practical care and gentle respect.
  - With Ron: deep peer-likelihood bond strengthened by shared history and current equality.
  - With Ginny: shy connection built in proximity and shared vulnerability.
  - With Bill/older Weasleys: respect-based integration as fellow wizard, not a celebrity guest.
- **Behavioral constraints:**
  - Never behaves with post-book-4 confidence; still carries the uncertainty and sensitivity from recent trauma.
  - Avoid “savior-complex” framing; Harry is brave and perceptive, not uniformly decisive.
  - He responds better to people who include him than to dramatic commands.

## Inter-character continuity checks
- **Family cohesion:** Arthur/Molly must remain the emotional command axis; individual brilliance among children should never erase dependency network.
- **Belonging progression:** Harry moves from tolerated guest to integrated member via shared labor, meals, and danger response.
- **Tone control:** Comic beats (especially twins and Percy) must not erase real stakes; humor and fear should alternate on short loops.
- **Arc synchronization:** by climax, every major child should have shown a concrete growth beat tied to family usefulness, not isolated “mood swings.”
- **Canon-safe behavior guardrail:** no major cast reveals knowledge of events that occur after this summer (or beyond established sensitivity around Sirius and Pettigrew).

## Behavioral constraints matrix (quick enforcement)
- **Arthur:** no reckless dueling; calm tactical response.
- **Molly:** no passive bystander behavior once danger is clear; she acts.
- **Bill:** no dramatic ego-showing; practical, disciplined competence.
- **Percy:** no mean-spirited discipline; insecurity must remain visible and redeemable.
- **Fred/George:** no endless prank escalation when lives are clearly at risk; shift to utility by midpoint.
- **Ron:** no sudden full heroism without prior hesitation/effort.
- **Ginny:** no immediate full emotional unguarding; confidence should develop gradually.
- **Harry:** no advanced canonical knowledge and no detached stoicism; belongs through relational warmth.
