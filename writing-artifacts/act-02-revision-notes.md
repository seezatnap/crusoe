# Act 2 Revision Notes — Task #26

## Scope
- Chapters reviewed and revised: 06–10
- Date: 2026-02-13
- Task focus: foreshadowing cadence, mystery-thread coherence, escalation logic, dialogue density, and character voice consistency.

## Word-count verification
- chapter-06.md: 5,975
- chapter-07.md: 5,780
- chapter-08.md: 5,360
- chapter-09.md: 5,890
- chapter-10.md: 4,930

All five chapters remain within the 4,000–6,000-word target.

## Revision summary
- `chapters/chapter-07.md`
  - Reworked a list-style debrief into a sequence of short dialogue beats to keep the chapter pace conversational and suspense-forward.
  - Added explicit tie-in from the Fog Hollow evidence back to Alcatraz/Chapter 6 symbol work, strengthening Act 2 mystery-thread coherence.
- `chapters/chapter-09.md`
  - Converted evidence summary list blocks to spoken-summary prose to increase dialogue density and keep the scene tone consistent.
  - Reframed the dawn response as verbalized operational sequence to clarify escalation logic.

## Verification outcomes

### 1) Foreshadowing cadence
- Confirmed recurring clues continue to escalate by scene: sensory wrongness in Chapter 6 -> active warehouse/Watcher proof in Chapter 7 -> legal threshold and professional escalation in Chapter 8 -> convergence planning in Chapter 9 -> trap-signal confirmation in Chapter 10.
- Added one direct connective line in Chapter 7 to ensure the reader can see the Foreshadow thread from Alcatraz into Fog Hollow operations.

### 2) Mystery-thread coherence
- Improved thread anchoring by explicitly naming that the same symbol family appears in both Alcatraz and the warehouse transfer evidence.
- Chapter 9 now states inference, pattern, and the operational plan in one continuous logic chain rather than fragmented note-style fragments.

### 3) Escalation logic
- Chapter 10 remains the strongest escalation point (first legal escort walk, active counter-surveillance, tracked markers, then emergency posture).
- Deconflicted the narrative from “fact gathering” into “controlled action plan” so every chapter now pushes to the next threat phase with reduced drift.

### 4) Dialogue density
- Two list-dense sections in Chapter 7 and Chapter 9 were converted to dialogue-first reporting.
- This increases oral exchange in high-tension scenes and better matches the project’s “dialogue-heavy” requirement.

### 5) Character voice consistency
- Edits kept each speaker inside established character register:
  - Ron = practical sequencing and calm tactical tone.
  - Bill = restrained, technical and precise.
  - Arthur = domestic authority with dry humour.
  - Marisol = tactical urgency, direct.
  - Tomo remains formal and operational in Chapter 8/10.
