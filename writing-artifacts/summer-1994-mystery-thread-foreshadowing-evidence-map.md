# Summer 1994 Mystery-Thread Foreshadowing & Evidence Map

Task reference: `#8`
Scope: Ensure foreshadowing and evidence for the mystery thread are introduced in Act II and closed in logical reveal moments through Act IV.
Threads tracked: Ginny’s sigil sketch, ward-decay clues, fog-compulsion preview, Barnacle sightings.

## 1) Mystery node map (act-by-act)

### A. Ginny’s sigil sketch
- **Act II seed:** Ch. 5 (Ginny POV at Coit Academy). Ginny copies a repeating geometric mark in her journal before understanding it.
- **Act II development:** Ch. 6 or Ch. 8 references to the same mark appearing in ritual-adjacent or ward-repair contexts should establish that it is a *signature*, not decoration.
- **Act III reveal setup:** Ch. 9 (Ron + Bill) explicitly identifies the mark as an Undertow ward-breaking/fog-anchor sigil and ties it to Alcatraz-Underlook corridor instability.
- **Act III pressure point:** Ch. 10 recon confirms physical evidence matching the sigil appears on maintenance fixtures and route markers.
- **Act IV payoff:** Ch. 14 exposes how Isolde/Voss use the sigil pattern as a staged key for anchor synchronization; Ch. 14–15 makes clear this is what the sketch was warning the family about all along.
- **Reveal timing guardrail:** Do not fully decode the sigil before Ch. 9; earlier explanation risks ending Act II with the antagonist model too clear.

### B. Ward decay / anomaly clues
- **Act II seed:** Ch. 6 (Alcatraz tour) gives first hard proof of active external pressure on legacy wards (not passive age decay).
- **Act II consolidation:** Ch. 8 and Ch. 9 should link Alcatraz signs to Fog Hollow drift points on one working model, creating one investigation vector rather than two separate problems.
- **Act III trigger:** Ch. 10 adds tactile evidence from tunnel edges, residue, and movement signatures proving a sustained campaign under the cover of normal maintenance.
- **Act III escalation:** Ch. 11 ties the same decay pattern to compulsion-safe fog channels in Fog Hollow, establishing public-risk scale.
- **Act IV payoff:** Ch. 13 establishes that the final ritual needs those weakened anchors; Ch. 14–15 should show Bill/Tomo reversing those nodes under time pressure as the climax’s decisive tactical logic.
- **Reveal timing guardrail:** Keep detailed anchor-math and specific failure points for Ch. 13–15 only; keep Act II observations sensory and inferential.

### C. Fog compulsion preview
- **Act II seed (tease):** Ch. 6 and Ch. 10 hint at controlled memory-softening signs, then keep scale ambiguous to maintain dread.
- **Act III reveal:** Ch. 11 is the explicit preview event where Voss tests public fog-laced compulsion on Fog Hollow residents.
- **Act III consequence mapping:** Ch. 11 must demonstrate this is rehearsed and intentional, not accidental weather magic; adults now face immediate protective decision-making.
- **Act IV payoff:** Ch. 14 uses the preview as rehearsal logic (same channels, denser patterns), and Ch. 15 shows Voss’s final personal compulsion attempt on Harry fail due to instinctive resistance already established.
- **Reveal timing guardrail:** Voss can attempt one full public fog-compulsion demonstration in Act III only; final “if successful” version is reserved for Act IV.

### D. Barnacle sightings (Harlan’s pelican surveillance)
- **Act II seed:** Ch. 7 gives first controlled Barnacle sighting with impossible patrol geometry.
- **Act II escalation:** Ch. 7/Ch. 8 references to repeated appearances should confirm this is not an ordinary animal.
- **Act III pressure point:** Ch. 10 or Ch. 11 allows Harlan’s use of the creature to be connected to route surveillance and corridor timing; this should coincide with the team noticing they are being watched.
- **Act III payoff:** Ch. 12 uses Barnacle behavior to justify the direct encounter and capture sequence (Harlan sees and responds before they do).
- **Act IV payoff:** Ch. 14 converts this clue into an active tactical weakness—its pattern gives Fred, George, and Marisol a timing exploit and contributes to Harlan’s overconfidence failure mode.
- **Reveal timing guardrail:** Do not explain Barnacle lineage until Ch. 12 (at the earliest); it is a threat readout first, lore reveal second.

## 2) Act-level reveal checkpoints (recommended cadence)

| Act | Mystery-state requirement at end of act | Reader payoff expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Act II (Ch. 5–8) | Distinct signals are seeded and connected as one operation: symbol, ward stress, unknown watcher, abnormal fog behavior. | Readers should know **something coordinated** is wrong, without knowing exact full ritual mechanics. |
| Act III (Ch. 9–12) | Coordination is proven and public stakes are demonstrated through the compulsion preview. | Readers should understand the antagonists can scale to community-level coercion and are actively tracking the group. |
| Act IV (Ch. 13–15) | All mystery nodes converge on Underlook/ritual architecture and a tactical plan to stop it emerges. | Readers should see full logic: why each clue mattered, why the final ritual is urgent, and why Isolde/Harlan failures matter. |

## 3) Reveal-to-chapter evidence alignment

| Chapter | Primary reveal added | Existing clue(s) paid off there | Why this chapter is the right reveal point |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | Sigil interpretation | Ginny’s repeated sketches | The first high-confidence decode belongs to Ron’s analytical mapping moment; it advances plot momentum without front-loading the ritual logic. |
9 | Anchor model | Ward decay patterns + compass/route oddities | Ron’s map synthesis gives a believable, skill-based revelation point. |
| 10 | Physical logistics of ritual prep | Maintenance residue + tunnel movement anomalies + compulsion trace | The investigators now possess evidence, not just theory. |
| 11 | Controlled compulsion test as intentional weapon | Fog memory drift + Ward fatigue signs | This is the transition from mystery to immediate conflict and stakes escalation. |
| 12 | Surveillance trap risk becomes personal | Barnacle sightings + counter-surveillance clues | The children’s underworld entry closes the “we’re being watched” arc and activates immediate danger. |
| 13 | Final target readiness and timing urgency | All Act II–III clues converge into one operational objective | Convergence point for adult-led strategy before Act IV execution. |
| 14 | Ritual signature mechanics and antagonist roles | All four threads should align as components | This is where the mystery is “explained for action,” not for exposition only. |
| 15 | Final compulsion failure and aftermath implication | Fog-preview logic + resistance evidence + sigil anchor disruption | This closes the mystery emotionally by linking clues to Harry’s growth and group survival. |

## 4) Continuity checks (for draft and revision loops)

- At each Act II–IV draft pass, confirm that no thread resolves fully before its scheduled reveal beat.
- Confirm each thread has a visible breadcrumb at least two chapters before its required payoff.
- Confirm each payoff has two supporting clues from earlier chapters so it cannot feel like retrofitted information.
- Confirm that every reveal shifts behavior immediately (new strategy, changed risk posture, altered group trust).
- Confirm that the final Act IV chapter resolves each thread’s practical implication, not only its visual motif.
