- Task focus: Postmortem and revision cycle for chapters 05-10, with tone-transition, escalation, and continuity checks against #6 and #5.

## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,585 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Solid escalation to interpersonal strain: Juno’s present decompensation, Fen witness pressure, and relationship confrontation with Cassiel are all present. | Keep this chapter’s end-to-end consequence path explicit before moving to chapter-08 institutional friction. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Matches #6 row 07 social-cost escalation and #5 act-level dependency after 2036 pressure logic. | Track this as required continuity handoff into #8 Maren warning sequence. | Story Editor | 2026-02-21 |
| Cliches | PASS | `CLIC-CLICHÉ` blocker removed by replacing repeated `as if` with `as though`; post-edit reports show no cliche blocker findings in ch-07. | Continue periodic pass for similar phrase families. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Dialogue Realism | FAIL | voice analyzer reports blocker-level `VOICE-STYLE-001`/POV-drift clustering near dense dialogue blocks; this blocks dialogue realism sign-off. | Add/repair POV continuity markers and tighten clustered dialogue attribution in dense scene sequence. | Agent Betty + Writing QA | 2026-02-25 |
| Pacing | PASS | Good present/recording pressure contour; chapter reaches social consequences before tonal exit. | Preserve the exit consequence beat for next chapter. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-lattice compression is sharp and embodied transitions into recording fragment remain purposeful. | Keep transitions tied to evidence discovery rather than scene-management cuts. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore-rule violation detected; institutional secrecy arc still consistent with continuity matrix. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: transition from present isolation to recording fragment is intentionally abrupt only where conflict forces it; no abrupt register drift found.
- Act-level escalation: major escalation point in this chapter due visible relational and behavioral degradation. This is the intended Act-2 turning of private cost into public consequence.
- Continuity with #6/#5: strong match with #6 row 07 and #5 dependency chain; no contradictions with #5 timeline rows 2036–2037 where social/technical tension begins to converge.

## Final Gate Decision

`NOT READY` (blocked on Dialogue Realism / voice consistency)
