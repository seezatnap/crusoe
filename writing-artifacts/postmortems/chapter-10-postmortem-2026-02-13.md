## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,468 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Concludes Act-2 build by revealing Sable’s infrastructure intent and living-process realization; clear Act-2 cap. | Keep this exit as direct setup for Act-3 escalation. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Matches #6 row 10 reveal sequence and #5 transition-era ending points; Rosetta as active infrastructure is canonically consistent with timeline. | None. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | No cliche findings and no blocked phrase repetition. | Maintain phrasing check in chapter-11 handoff. | Writing QA | 2026-02-20 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | No blocker findings in latest validation run. | Maintain attribution discipline in journal/recorded scenes. | - | - |
| Pacing | PASS | Clear ascent, midpoint reveal, and release/recognition close. | Preserve final emotional residue in chapter-11 setup. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Strong present-lattice entry, then recording deep-dive with embodied sensory detail; transitions are intentional and motivated. | Keep transition seam explicit at chapter end. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | Major lore reveal is within continuity scope and does not exceed permitted Act-2 release depth. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: highly controlled present-to-recording shift, then return to present decision point.
- Act-level escalation: chapter provides major Act-2 climax with infrastructure reveal and explicit stakes that carry to Act-3 truth phase.
- Continuity with #6/#5: full match with #6 row 10 and #5 reveal row for Rosetta-Key realization as living architecture.
