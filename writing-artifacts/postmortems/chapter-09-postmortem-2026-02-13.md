## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,995 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Converts private suspicion into documented obstruction from Orin: access denials and lock-downs are now concrete. | Carry this confrontation logic as the preface for chapter-10 discovery turn. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Direct match with #6 row 09 dependency and #5 row 09 escalation logic from restricted archive mechanics and policy enforcement. | None. | - | - |
| Cliches | WARN | 2 non-blocking cliche warnings (phrase frequency), below failure threshold. | Optionally tighten one phrase family to remove warnings. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | No blocker-level dialogue issues in latest threshold run; warnings are informational and manageable. | Keep track of dialogue density in final edits. | Writing QA | 2026-02-20 |
| Pacing | PASS | Strong forward pressure: meeting, deflection, follow-through, consequence planning. | Keep closing consequence line that translates frustration into action. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present register remains concrete and institutionally grounded; tone remains consistent with escalation phase. | Continue to avoid abstraction drift in final pass. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore-rule break; obstruction appears as expected under matrix dependencies. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: minimal but controlled; mostly present register with stable institutional texture and no disruptive shifts.
- Act-level escalation: clear move from suspicion to action-based confrontation; marks decisive transition into explicit policy conflict.
- Continuity with #6/#5: strong continuity against #6 row 09 and #5 dependency logic through late-2040s institutional split mechanics.

## Final Gate Decision
