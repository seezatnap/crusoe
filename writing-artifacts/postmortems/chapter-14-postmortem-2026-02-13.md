## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,996 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Maren’s confession and witness protocol transfer complete the chapter’s arc and move directly into infrastructure access preparation. | Confirm chapter-15 opening uses the witness framework as immediate consequence. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Final key inheritance transfer logic aligns with Act-3 closure and unresolved thread handoff in current roadmap. | Keep Maren/Juno emotional causality explicit across the chapter boundary. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | Sanitized and direct quality runs both show no cliche blockers. | Keep sentence-level variety when revising the opening quarter. | Writing QA | 2026-02-21 |
| Dialogue Realism | PASS | Dialogue attribution is still warning-heavy in logs but now below blocker/error thresholds; no quality blockers remain. | Add explicit tags only where sentence-level clarity materially improves reader disambiguation. | Writing QA | 2026-02-23 |
| Pacing | PASS | Strong close: confession, directive, witness preparation, and infrastructure access all occur with escalating consequence. | Preserve this cadence and avoid adding non-consequential reflective pauses. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Witness/ethics scenes sustain a controlled, somber register while ending transitions into operational clarity. | Keep transitions from testimony to action explicit. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore contradiction surfaced relative to revealed-or-inherited architecture and witness governance framework. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Revelation logic reaches chapter-14 crescendo through the witness mechanism and final non-delegable truth burden language.
- Antagonist evolution is coherent: Orin is no longer merely opposing, but now appears to have structurally monopolized continuity safeguards.
- Ethical stakes alignment improved by the added "witness" reframing, emphasizing communal accountability rather than individual martyrdom.
