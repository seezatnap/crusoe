## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 5,945 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Introduces Maren warning as explicit continuity lever and pushes to Curator-friction stage; sets act-pressure transfer to chapter-09 confrontation. | Keep unresolved Orin question explicit through first half of chapter-09. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-22 |
| Continuity | PASS | Maps directly to #6 row 08 (Maren warning), #5 transition-row anchor around late 2030s/2040 design constraints and restraint logic. | Ensure warning language remains tied to Rosetta-resistance mechanism in later revisions. | Story Editor | 2026-02-21 |
| Cliches | PASS | `CLIC-CLICHÉ` blocker removed by replacing repeated `as if` with `as though`; cliche report currently shows no blocker. | Keep running anti-cliché scan during scene integration. | Agent Betty | 2026-02-20 |
| Dialogue Realism | FAIL | Multiple blocker-level `VOICE-STYLE-001` and POV-drift events remain in voice analysis. | Standardize dialogue tagging/character attribution and explicit POV breaks in Curator-office and Maren segments. | Agent Betty + Writing QA | 2026-02-25 |
| Pacing | PASS | Escalation is cumulative: visit scene -> warning -> restricted response -> evidence collection -> constrained station close. | Maintain stakes cadence in opening half and avoid repeated compressed introspection blocks. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Register transitions are mostly explicit and motivated (Maren dock/intimacy to Curator/office institutional register). | Ensure each transition states what changed in Juno’s objective. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No lore violations introduced; warning is consistent with prior Orin protection framing. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Tone transitions: strong present/recording and private/public contrast; one of the clearest transitions in Act-2.
- Act-level escalation: marks transition from investigation accumulation to explicit institutional confrontation via Orin and restricted network response.
- Continuity with #6/#5: clear fit with #6 row 08 and #5 timeline rows for late transition-era constraints and design-stage pressure.

## Final Gate Decision

`NOT READY` (blocked on Dialogue Realism / voice consistency)
