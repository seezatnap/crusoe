## Gate Matrix

| Check | Status | Findings | Action | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-Count Compliance | PASS | 4,843 words (within 4,000–6,000). | None. | - | - |
| Plot Progression | PASS | Chapter-15 creates the decisive branch selection (remove/suppress/open), then commits to the witness-first mode as the operational path into Act-4 consequence. | Keep Chapter-16 explicit about phase-0 execution and the practical effects of public protocol release. | - | - |
| Continuity | PASS | `chapter-14` emotional and procedural handoff is continuous: Maren burden language is inherited as operational doctrine and Orin’s resistance remains structurally consistent. | Preserve the “no forced collapse/no forced silence” framing as the through-line into chapters 16–17. | - | - |
| Cliches | PASS | `as if` repetition removed in revision and no cliche blockers remain in latest quality run. | Continue sentence-level variation in high-density policy scenes. | Writing QA | 2026-02-26 |
| Dialogue Realism | WARN | The automated voice analyzer reports many continuation-based dialogue blocks (`DIAL-TAG-001/002`) because chapter-15 uses rapid line-switch scenes without explicit speaker tags. | Add explicit speaker lines where ambiguity remains in chapter-15’s denser exchanges before final archive. | Writing QA | 2026-02-20 |
| Pacing | PASS | Strong escalation arc in chapter-15: proposal framing → public hearing → public release decision. | Keep the chapter end as an operational transition rather than a false final resolution. | - | - |
| Tone Stability | PASS | Present-Lattice tone remains controlled and process-heavy while preserving character-level emotional stakes around decision burden. | Avoid adding additional reflective prose before procedural closure beats the scene open. | - | - |
| Lore Safety | PASS | No new lore claims introduced beyond established Rosetta/guardrail architecture; witness-first language fits the established framework. | - | - | - |

## Special Review

- Ending coherence is strong for a threshold chapter: the ending lands on `phase 0` activation and open public release with safeguards, which cleanly hands off to Chapter-16 public execution.
- Emotional posture is credible: Juno’s lines acknowledge the burden and uncertainty, rather than claiming victory.
- Open-thread posture is intentional: the chapter ends with unresolved civic choice but with procedural visibility and witness chain in place.

## Validation Note

- Full quality session run for this chapter now uses `quality-orchestrator-1771014748.md` (targeting `final-draft-chapters/chapter-15.md`) and passes at error threshold (`status: passed`, total findings: 123, 0 blocking reports).
- Remaining warnings are dialogue-attribution hygiene and should be treated as a cleanup pass, not a lore/continuity blocker.

## Final Gate Decision

`PASS`
