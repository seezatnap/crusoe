# Risk Register (Task #10)

**Purpose:** Identify writing and continuity risks tied to unresolved threads, secrets, and ethical dilemmas in chapter-level planning.  
**Method:** Reassess whenever chapter beats shift; downgrade a risk when a thread is resolved or reframed.

| ID | Source thread(s) | Risk | Chapter touchpoints | Impact | Likelihood | Detection signal | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | Q-01, E-01 | If physical-world uncertainty is dismissed too early, the opening thematic question loses stakes and the Lattice may feel arbitrary | 1, 8, 14, 17 | High | Medium | Expository narration explains the point before emotional pressure exists | Keep reveal-to-question loop tied to Maren, Orin, and Act 4 public fallout |
| R-02 | Q-02, E-03 | Drift/memory erosion is underplayed, allowing bleed scenes to read as decoration rather than real risk | 7, 11, 13, 17 | Medium-High | High | Symptoms appear abstract and never increase in cost | Track progressive Juno behavior shifts each chapter |
| R-03 | S-02, Q-03, Q-04, E-02 | The Rosetta Key is presented as too magical or too technical without enough evidence | 4, 10, 12, 14, 15 | High | Medium | Key explanations are vague or repeated without escalation | Stage explanation in bounded increments by chapter function |
| R-04 | S-01, Q-05, E-01 | Curator control over missing recordings is too sudden, weakening institutional credibility | 3, 9, 10, 13, 16 | Medium | Medium | Orin appears villainous without prior procedural groundwork | Ground his actions in long-term maintenance/containment rationale |
| R-05 | S-04, Q-05, Q-06 | Maren’s late lucidity can feel accidental if not foreshadowed, or manipulative if over-explained | 8, 14, 17 | Medium | Medium | Maren’s warnings are either confusing or too coherent | Anchor her lucidity around drift-state triggers and visual/sensory motifs |
| R-06 | S-03, Q-04, E-06 | Constraint architecture revelation may lack personal and political consequences | 6, 10, 12, 15 | High | Medium | Discovery does not change relationships or stakes across chapters | Tie every technical reveal to a choice affecting at least one character |
| R-07 | E-04, S-06, Q-05 | Consent/privacy framing is too shallow, exposing the project to avoidable ethical criticism | 2, 4, 5, 6, 15, 17 | High | Low-Medium | Mind-jump scenes feel purely instrumental | Insert at least one scene where Juno/Agnostic witness reflects on ethical cost |
| R-08 | E-05, Q-04, R-02 | Act 4 choice can collapse into binary sermon (remove all constraints vs suppress truth) | 15, 16, 17 | High | Medium | No workable third path is demonstrated in action | Preserve both practical steps and emotional cost in resolution scenes |
| R-09 | S-02, E-02, S-07 | Public disclosure of architecture could be depicted as one-time event rather than staged process | 10, 15, 16 | Medium | High | Crowd reaction lacks gradient and local variation | Add progressive reaction beats across Lattice groups and generations |
| R-10 | S-07, E-03, Q-02 | Bleed as a risk signal is either omitted or overused, creating tonal inconsistency | 7, 11, 13, 17 | Medium | Medium | Either too mild or too frequent symptoms | Log physiological/sensory markers and social consequences in each major episode |

## Monitoring Checklist (Per Chapter Draft)

1. Verify each newly introduced thread is added to the unresolved-thread log with chapter linkage.
2. For each chapter, mark at least one risk as `addressed`, `escalated`, or `resolved` in the postmortem notes.
3. Escalate risk if thread-linking conflicts with Chapter word budget or postmortem continuity checks.
4. Carry unresolved risks forward only if they contribute directly to final Act 4 choice architecture.
