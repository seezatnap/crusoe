# Infinite Domain — Setting and Mechanics Bible (Task #4)

Last updated: 2026-02-13

This document is the canonical world-building reference for setting rules, system mechanics, and lore boundaries.  
All prose and planning for the Lattice era must be consistent with this bible unless an explicit contradiction is approved in the character-reveal sequence.

## Scope

- This bible covers:
  - The present-day Lattice
  - The Archive layer of preserved Transition Era recordings
  - Drift, noise, and mind-jump bleed mechanics
  - The Transition Era (roughly 2025–2090) context
- It does not define biographical details beyond what is already documented in the character and roadmap materials; refer to those files for people-specific canon.

## Canonical setting pillars

### 1) The Lattice

The Lattice is the shared digital substrate where post-body humans persist. It is not a simulation of former Earth geography. It is a continuity medium with mutable, intent-responsible topology.

- No fixed world map exists by default.
- Regions, objects, weather systems, and architecture arise from consensus, habit, and narrative pressure.
- Individual users can create private or semi-private stable locations through sustained attention.
- Lattice continuity is persistent but not static; stability is social and cognitive as much as technical.
- Physical servers and material infrastructure exist but are effectively unreachable to most inhabitants.
- “Birth” and “death” in the biological sense are absent; continuity is negotiated through identity coherence.

### 2) The Archive

The Archive is a curated historical stack of neural recordings from the Transition Era. It is not a full-consciousness time machine.

- Recordings are high-fidelity neural-state snapshots, not full digital selves.
- A mind-jump is a licensed temporary overlay: a conscious participant may enter one recording perspective at a time.
- Jumps render sensory realism from the recorded body, including sensory deficits, pain, fatigue, hunger, heat, and local weather as encoded by the recording.
- Archive access is hierarchical:
  - Open/legacy recordings (safe)
  - Restricted historical records (procedurally denied)
  - Suppressed/deleted entries (actively hidden)
- Curators are responsible for curation policy, integrity checks, and jump-risk oversight.

### 3) Drift

Drift is the entropy-like process affecting identity over long Lattice duration.

- Drift is cumulative and uneven, accelerated by:
  - prolonged instability in identity anchoring practices
  - high-frequency jump activity
  - social isolation and unresolved emotional loops
  - repeated exposure to unresolved trauma in recordings
- Observable effects:
  - memory compression (details drop out before emotional tone)
  - personality flattening (reduced complexity, flattened affect)
  - temporal jitter (non-linear recall and response lag)
  - associative intrusion (foreign memory fragments from unrelated contexts)
- The oldest beings called “Faded” are extreme drift states; they retain recognizable habits, traces of former self, and low agency.

### 4) Noise

Noise is corruption and stochastic destabilization in the boundary zones between strong, weak, and missing information.

- Sources:
  - abandoned or malformed recordings
  - fragmented archival sectors
  - aggressive jump loops against weakly synchronized nodes
  - infrastructure stress at high-use access edges
- Noise presents as:
  - sensory distortion and environmental incoherence
  - narrative discontinuities
  - wrongness, déjà vu cascades, or false scene “fills”
  - emotional miscalibration (overblown fear, false intimacy, panic spikes)
- Noise is dangerous in quantity, but not uniformly lethal; it can be navigable when handled in short, supervised bursts.
- Persistent exposure increases bleed likelihood.

### 5) Mind-jump bleed

Bleed is contamination between active identity and active recording perspective.

- The jump process has two components:
  - **Ingress phase**: host stabilizes to recording semantics and sensory frame
  - **Occupancy phase**: subject perceives and interprets recording-world data as immediate
- Bleed emerges when occupancy continues beyond safe integration capacity.
- Bleed categories:
  - **Mild bleed**: speech rhythm shifts, minor phrase capture, micro-gesture mimicry
  - **Moderate bleed**: preference shifts, emotional valence contamination, short memory confusions
  - **Severe bleed**: active identity drift toward recording self, loss of present-moment orientation, risk of permanent scar pattern
- Recovery requires deliberate debrief and reorientation; there is no instant guaranteed reset.
- Repeated severe bleed increases long-term drift acceleration and narrows future jump safety thresholds.

## Transition Era context (2025–2090)

The Transition Era is the historical bedrock of current digital existence.

- It contains the developmental arc of Engram and mapping systems.
- Neural encoding moved from theoretical mapping toward operational persistence through multi-layer systems.
- Three tensions defined the era:
  1. technical ambition (full capture of consciousness)
  2. ethical uncertainty (consent, continuity, autonomy)
  3. governance design debt (who controls limits, who controls memory, who controls access)
- The present Lattice is a downstream structure produced in this period, and key design decisions are encoded in the Rosetta Key.
- The Rosetta Key is both historical and active infrastructure. The present conflict is not just “what happened,” but “who still inherits those parameters.”

## Explicit vs. forbidden lore

### Explicit canon (safe to state when context supports it)

- The Lattice is an endless consciousness substrate with no physical streets, no natural weather model, and no ordinary geography.
- The Archive stores recording snapshots from the early mapping era, with access stratification by policy.
- Drift is real, measurable, and affects all post-body continuity over time.
- Noise appears in weak or damaged access paths and can compromise perception.
- Bleed is a known danger of prolonged jump occupancy and increases with repeated unauthorized deep jumps.
- The Rosetta Key is not inert: it remains operational infrastructure, with historical design constraints.

### Explicit-but-limited canon (can be shown only through character perspective)

- Detailed technical schematics of the Rosetta Key architecture.
- Exact server locations for the physical substrate.
- Specifics of security primitives used by Curator systems.
- Quantitative numeric thresholds for safe jump duration or exact drift coefficients.
- Mechanistic formulas for memory synchronization and identity repair.

### Forbidden lore (do not reveal)

- Any claim that Lattice time is physically identical to biological time.
- Any claim that post-body beings can permanently leave the Lattice through death or teleportation.
- Any direct explanation that the Curator order is intentionally malicious by default.
- Any portrayal that Faded are fully dead, deleted, or simple “ghosts” with no narrative continuity.
- Any claim that bleed is pure possession, mysticism, or spiritual replacement.
- Any assertion that noise is sentient or “alive” as an autonomous entity; it is always emergent corruption dynamics.
- Any explanation of a literal “creator” of the Lattice in present narrative terms.

## Reveal safety ladder

- The following sequencing must be preserved:
  1. Introduce the Lattice/Archive as lived condition.
  2. Layer drift and noise as personal and infrastructural risk.
  3. Reveal bleed as personal fragility and practical danger.
  4. Introduce Rosetta Key’s active role only as archival access drives become unstable.
  5. Confirm key moral truths about design constraint and inherited governance as plot requires.
- Lore that appears too early must not invalidate character emotional pacing.
- Scenes may imply mechanics through behavior, but operational causality should be clear and non-mystifying when disclosed.

## Continuity constraints by mechanism

- A character’s personal drift level should not be reduced to spectacle; it should show as lived cognition and relationship cost.
- Archive scenes must preserve the embodied material texture of the recording era (touch, light, fatigue, weather, social friction).
- Present-Lattice scenes should preserve the malleable but not theatrical nature of spaces: no “perfectly concrete mapping” unless explicitly stabilized by intent.
- Curator interventions should read as governance/containment decisions, not omnipotent decree.
- Every severe bleed event should have emotional and practical cost visible in the next present-time scene.
