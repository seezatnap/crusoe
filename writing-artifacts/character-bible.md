## Canonical notes

- Reveal order should prioritize emotional readiness:
  1. Juno’s private obsession and risk profile.
  2. Orin’s custodial bias and control strategy.
  3. Maren’s fractured knowledge under drift.
  4. Sable’s constraint architecture and the moral paradox of safety.
  5. Full social consequences in public choice structure (Act 4).
