# Timeline and Continuity Tracker

## Timeline Basis

- All scenes use one project timeline, referenced to the night of the murder.
- Murder reference point: **Night 0, 23:00**, the period in which Dr. Joe Hale is found dead in Hallowford House.
- Unless a chapter explicitly restates it, all earlier or later references are interpreted relative to Night 0.
- All future chapters must preserve a single, monotonic sequence for chapter-level chronology.

## Chronological Event Table (provisional spine)

| time_anchor | chapter | event_id | event | location | continuity_impact | unresolved_risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D-1 late afternoon | CH-025 preface references | T-000 | Joe Hale detects accounting and medicine discrepancies tied to external pressure and decides to secure evidence privately. | Saint Jude’s Clinic / Hallowford House | Establishes motive pressure before the murder window; affects later claims of premeditation. | Confirm exact record where he flags discrepancies first. |
| Night 0 18:00 | CH-01 | T-001 | Joe returns to Hallowford House as weather and fog close the late-night mobility of streets and docks. | Hallowford House | Establishes baseline for death window and possible movement constraints. | Check tram/bell reference for this transfer. |
| Night 0 21:00–23:00 | CH-01 | T-002 | Household and scene are established as inaccessible to casual entry. | Hallowford House | Locks continuity axis for locked-room premise. | Verify whether any service access was logged during this exact segment. |
| Night 0 23:00 | CH-01 | T-003 | Joe is discovered dead; room sealed conditions observed by Pencombe and Vale. | Hallowford House | Defines the hard starting fact for all subsequent reconstruction. | Bell and weather witness alignment must be explicit in final prose. |
| Night 0 +1 hour | CH-02 | T-004 | Folded clinic-related note recovered from Joe’s person (with coded shorthand). | Hallowford House | Introduces medical-chain link and access motive thread. | Preserve exact wording from Chapter 2 once drafted. |
| Morning 0 (same night to dawn) | CH-02 / CH-03 | T-005 | Telegraphed update and household interviews reveal conflicting clock/bell witness windows. | Hallowford House / Station House | First major continuity stressor between social recollection and log data. | Resolve whether any witness used station bell as time anchor. |
| Dawn to Midday | CH-03 | T-006 | Clinic records check shows restricted compound access irregularities and possible forged/unclear entries. | Saint Jude’s Clinic | Introduces medicine chain continuity for motive and method. | Keep ledger signatures distinct from public stock logs. |
| Morning | CH-04 | T-007 | Clara’s domestic timeline reconstructs a late-hour service discrepancy (missing key return interval). | Hallowford House | Supports timeline contradiction proving internal house access manipulation. | Clarify exact key object and custody transfer chain. |
| Night+1 | CH-05 | T-008 | Evelyn describes theater contact route; Joe had post-social movement before death window. | Glass Lantern Theater / Hallowford route | Adds social cover-layer that must stay plausible with transport windows. | Match theater and corridor times with chapter 1 and 3 timestamps. |
| Night+1 | CH-06 | T-009 | Telegraph relay gap identified: one emergency message is delayed/mutated. | Mire Street Station House | Establishes communications as a manipulated variable in timeline. | Confirm relay origin line and operator name at draft stage. |
| Night+1 to Night+3 | CH-07 / CH-08 / CH-09 | T-010 | Duplicate key chain investigation begins across locksmith and house records. | Locksmith / Hallowford / Tallow Wharf | Locks the access hypothesis and key-custody chain. | Need one source for who ordered the copy and why. |
| Night+2 | CH-10 | T-011 | Legal documents reviewed; delay amendment appears designed to defer disclosure. | Office / Station House | Adds legal-time manipulation to the continuity axis. | Tie amendment date to murder-time communication chain. |
| Night+2 | CH-11 / CH-12 | T-012 | Anonymous ledger packet enters investigation; contains genuine and planted evidence fragments. | Station House / Archive Annex | Enforces source-trace discipline between evidence and chain-of-custody. | Flag each mixed-origin page with provenance note. |
| Night+3 | CH-13 | T-013 | Joe’s sealed statement is read; confirms dual-control architecture on key + medicine. | Hallowford / Station House | Midpoint reversal of case scope: from singular-room puzzle to institutional silence operation. | Preserve full quote chain and avoid retroactive interpretation. |
| Night+4 | CH-14 | T-014 | Joe’s hidden records-closet key is discovered; indicates premeditated evidence redundancy. | Hallowford / Records closet | Shows victim intent and strengthens sequence logic for suppression plot. | Ensure key geometry and custody references stay identical. |
| Night+4 | CH-15 | T-015 | Night-walk witness confirms Joe carried sealed packet into household late in final hours. | Saint Jude’s / Hallowford entry | Aligns packet timeline with medicine-route evidence. | Keep packet physical description consistent across chapters. |
| Night+5 | CH-16 / CH-17 | T-016 | Social confrontation and dock-path terrain test make an entry route physically plausible. | Lantern Room / Observatory Path | Confirms mechanical possibility of non-forced movement under weather conditions. | Reconfirm path timing against tram and tide windows. |
| Night+5 to Night+6 | CH-18 / CH-19 | T-017 | Telegraphed alibi contradiction narrows suspects; compound routes are reconciled to private cache trail. | Station logs / Saint Jude’s / Tallow Wharf | Major continuity lock: suspect opportunities must pass one route-time test. | Decide final invalidated suspect set before chapter 20 rewrite. |
| Night+6 | CH-20 | T-018 | Photograph links secondary operator to duplicate key chain and dock movement corridor. | Josephine archive / Dock manifests | Unifies person-tracking and logistics networks. | Confirm visual identification consistency in prose. |
| Night+7 | CH-21 | T-019 | Legal contingency review confirms staged disclosure and record-lock delay strategy. | Legal offices / Station House | Places legal manipulation in final culpability branch. | Preserve exact clause language for reader accessibility. |
- Night+7 to Night+8 | CH-22 | T-020 | Weather, clock, and tram sequence simulation demonstrates exact transfer window. | City streets / Hallowford approach | Final timeline pin-down before confrontation sequence. | Must be numerically testable: no floating-hour assumptions. |
| Night+8 | CH-23 | T-021 | Controlled reveal reconstructs key chain + medicine chain + clock window before witnesses. | Hallowford Quiet Room | Climax proof event; must preserve one continuous causal chain. | Verify no event outside permitted actor list appears in final pass. |
| Dawn after Night+8 | CH-24 | T-022 | Public correction phase begins: institutional fallout and record corrections. | Brackwater civic venues | Continuity transition from investigation mode to civic consequence mode. | Maintain that legal correction follows arrest, not before. |
| Dawn +1 | CH-25 | T-023 | Final civic and family closure; motifs and timeline references tied to dawn repair arc. | Brackwater / Hallowford / Clinic | Resolution event: all major open threads must be marked resolved or formally parked. | Verify no unresolved key clue remains unaccounted for. |

## Timeline Integrity Rules

1. **Single Source Clock Rule**  
   Every scene introducing a time reference must include at least one physical anchor: clock, tram schedule, bell strike, tide log, or official log entry.

2. **Monotonic Time Rule**  
   Narrative time cannot reverse unless clearly marked as memory, report, or evidence reconstruction.

3. **Travel Feasibility Rule**  
   Any movement between major locations must be checked against 1938 Brackwater transport and weather conditions.

4. **Access Trace Rule**  
   Any scene involving keys, logs, or custody transitions must specify who had possession immediately before and after the transition.

5. **Evidence Provenance Rule**  
   All documents, packets, and records mentioned as evidence must have provenance and custody notes before they are interpreted as motive logic.

6. **Continuity Debt Rule**  
   If a timeline claim conflicts with earlier text, chapter draft cannot pass review until corrected or explicitly marked as retrospective reconstruction.

7. **Thread Closure Rule**  
   Any open thread unresolved for more than three chapter beats must be captured in the unresolved-thread log with a planned closure chapter.

## Draft Continuity Check Template

For each chapter draft, record:

- `time_anchor` values used
- `location` transitions with expected transit time
- `key custody` transitions
- `clock/bell/tide references`
- Opened/closed events from this chapter
- New unsatisfied continuity assumptions introduced

| TOBJ-05 | Identity and role of the key courier | open | T-018 | T-020, T-021 | CH-23 | Keep courier identity and action scope consistent with dock-route and telegraph windows. |
| TMOT-06 | Family-level concealment boundaries | active | T-016 | T-015, T-014 | CH-24 | Determine which family decisions were protective versus complicit before final social reckoning. |
| TINT-07 | Public narrative damage control | open | T-020 | T-021, T-022 | CH-24 | Ensure newspaper and civic corrections do not release records before lawful trigger chapter. |

## Continuity Handoff Notes (for CH-021 transition)

- Before moving beyond chapter 20, CH-022 must close all thread dependencies related to mobility, telegraph timing, and key custody.
- CH-023 should close or reclassify every active thread in this table; unresolved items may only remain if explicitly moved to denouement governance.
