# World Design Document — *On the Fall of Dr. Joe*

## 1) Core Premise

The story is set in a fogbound English coastal city where reputation and social standing are currency.  
Dr. Joe Hale, respected municipal physician and wartime researcher, falls from the public eye when he is found dead in a room that should have been locked to the world.  
The investigation unfolds across one storm-bound week in a city where everyone knows everyone else’s business, and where a private scandal can drown a person faster than the tide.

## 2) Era and Historical Frame

- **Primary era:** Late 1930s (1938), interwar Britain.
- **Technology baseline:**
  - Landline telephones in institutions and wealthy homes.
  - Public telegraph and newspaper presses with same-day updates.
  - Trains and tram lines connect city districts but are not instantaneous.
  - Forensics exist in limited form: fingerprints, fiber/hair comparison, blood typing, and glass/soil residue inspection; no DNA databases, no digital forensics, no CCTV.
- **Public culture:** Class boundaries are rigid, wartime wounds are still fresh, and institutions still project an image of order while quietly unraveling.
- **Medicine and psychiatry:** Modern enough to be respected, but still mixed with stigma, superstition, and hierarchy.

## 3) Setting: Brackwater

Brackwater is a 1938 coastal industrial market city of 220,000 residents with three social layers in plain view:

- **Upper Quayside:** Private clubs, council offices, and inherited mansions.
- **Middle Causeways:** Shops, clinics, boarding houses, and railway-linked commuter districts.
- **Narrow Harbor Ward:** Dockside tenements, refitted warehouses, and the city’s undocumented shadows.

The city is geographically compact and socially tangled. Most key characters live or work within short travel distance, allowing movement, alibis, and lies to be checked against each other without modern mobility.

## 4) Location Atlas (Primary Story Locales)

1. **Saint Jude’s Infirmary (upper ward)**  
   Dr. Joe’s medical practice and principal workplace. A place of authority, records, and private access.
2. **Hallowford House (Bracken Court)**  
   The Hale family’s ancestral home and site of the death scene. Built as a hybrid of Georgian architecture and practical municipal upgrades.
3. **Mire Street Station House**  
   Police headquarters, where records are logged manually and all leads are constrained by paperwork and hierarchy.
4. **The Glass Lantern Theater**  
   Social observatory for the city’s elite; used for public appearances, private meetings, and reputation laundering.
5. **The Tallow Wharf**  
   Wet dock district where cargo manifests can vanish, and witnesses are paid to forget what they see.
6. **The Old Observatory Lane**  
   Abandoned wind-protected hillside walk ending at cliff paths and drainage tunnels; used as a geography of eavesdropping and private exchanges.
7. **The Municipal Archive Annex**  
   A bureaucratic vault of permits, death certificates, and correspondence—slow to search, crucial for motive and timeline.
8. **The Lantern Room (roof-level tea bar)**  
   Neutral social space where characters perform civility while slipping into disclosure.

## 5) Atmosphere and Tonal Rules

- **Weather rule:** The city is frequently fogged by tidal mists and intermittent sleet. Outdoor scenes prioritize muffled sound, dim light, and interrupted sightlines.
- **Soundscape:** Bells, tram wheels, foghorns, and rain are recurring cues; silence is used as narrative pressure.
- **Color economy:** Muted stone, coal black, damp wool, and sodium lamps. Bright reds are rare and reserved for injury, warning, and revelation scenes.
- **Emotional temperature:** Polite surfaces with deep undercurrents. Public calm should always crack briefly before each major reveal.

## 6) Governing World Rules

### A. Physical and procedural rules
- Public clocks and tide tables are shared references; time disputes must be reconciled against dock bells, train departures, and station logs.
- Keys are analog: copies can be made by any capable locksmith, but provenance of access keys is always trackable through service stamps and witness memory.
- Doors and shutters can fail mechanically in damp weather; investigators must consider mechanical unreliability before assuming intent.
- Communications have delay: even urgent calls are often repeated through relay points, creating exploitable uncertainty in timelines.

### B. Social/institutional rules
- Class affects who is believed, but not absolute truth. A servant’s account can be correct and still be politically ignored unless corroborated.
- Family medical legacy is protected; physicians, especially specialists, can request restricted access to records by invoking civic emergency terms.
- The local press amplifies rumors faster than evidence. A lead can become a suspect in print before police confirmation.

### C. Investigative constraints
- No private laboratories with modern forensic speed. Any lab evidence takes time and chain-of-custody risks.
- The inspectorate works from witness statements, records, and physical traces before building theory. A “solution” must be built from observable cause-and-effect.
- The detective cannot rely on confession alone; confessions without corroboration are considered narratively unstable.

## 7) Explicit Mystery-Genre Constraints (for this world)

1. **Fair-play evidence rule:** Every pivotal clue must be available in the narrative no later than the chapter in which it is first discussed as useful.
2. **Closed-circle anchor:** At least during the murder window, anyone with realistic access must be one of a defined set of insiders tied to Saint Jude’s, Hallowford House, and the dock logistics route.
3. **No omniscient access:** Protagonist and suspects operate with incomplete knowledge and can be wrong in good faith.
4. **Mechanical plausibility first:** Any improbable action requires documented means, witness overlap, and timing proof.
5. **No supernatural intervention:** Illness, fear, and social pressure do the frightening work, not the paranormal.
6. **Red herring integrity:** Misleading clues may be convincing but must be technically explainable and non-contradictory with future truth.
7. **Motive over magic:** The final reveal must hinge on plausible human motive, not hidden technology, secret monsters, or impossible documents.
8. **No final-line contrivance:** The solution cannot rely on an element introduced only at the end without earlier narrative support.
9. **Consequence rule:** Every false lead increases pressure; a false lead must cost at least one character a meaningful resource (reputation, leverage, freedom, or trust).
10. **Reader agency rule:** The reader should be able to suspect the true culprit by collecting clues from setting, testimony, and physical limits.

## 8) Lore Constraints for Future Chapters

- Brackwater is modern enough for telegraphs and rail, but still vulnerable to analog delay and institutional gatekeeping.
- Storm and fog are recurring environmental obstacles, not decorative backdrop.
- The city’s institutions preserve records, but records can be incomplete, damaged, or politically “lost.”
- Dr. Joe’s professional standing makes him socially visible and therefore dangerous as a narrative anchor: motives tied to him must intersect with money, reputation, medicine, and family inheritance.

## 9) Continuity Anchors

- Keep all chapter references to physical geography consistent: distances in Brackwater are short enough that routine movement takes minutes, not hours, unless weather or official duty interrupts.
- Keep era-specific objects consistent: all rooms without electricity backups, all lighting and travel described accordingly.
- Keep investigative tempo anchored to weather windows: severe fog can delay sightings, not rewrite chronology.
- Keep clues grounded in available tools: fingerprint blot books, paper logs, key registries, tram schedules, and paper correspondence.

This document establishes the world grammar for all future planning artifacts and chapter prose: the mystery must remain locked to analog-era procedure, social pressure, and verifiable evidence.
