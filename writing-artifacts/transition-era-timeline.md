# Infinite Domain — Transition Era Timeline (2025–2090)

Last updated: 2026-02-13  
Task tie-in: `#5` (Construct a historical timeline for the Transition Era tied to Lena, Sable, Marcus, and Engram milestones.)

## Scope and assumptions

- Core era: 2025–2090, with emphasis on the period where the Engram line moved from theory to active infrastructure.
- The timeline is built from canonical notes in `writing-artifacts/character-bible.md` and `writing-artifacts/setting-bible.md`.
- "Scene anchor" entries are planning hooks for future chapter beat placements. Most are tied to the canonical chapter structure in `writing-artifacts/roadmap.md` because full chapters do not yet exist.
- All chapter anchors are provisional and should be treated as draft alignment points, not fixed canon.

## Transition-era timeline

| Period | Engram milestone | Lena / Marcus / Sable beat | Scene anchors (recording-era) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | Research alignment period begins: multinational neuroscience and AI groups agree that memory-preserving neural maps are technically feasible if enough sampling density can be sustained | Lena enters high-frequency systems-capture labs as senior cognitive lead (theoretical framing); Marcus builds project infrastructure; Sable joins policy discussions around signal denoising | `Ch.02` — “peripheral recording” montage: archival lab culture in early 2025; first references to the Engram consortium appear as background context for Lena/Marcus/Sable |
| 2026–2027 | First high-volume cortical sampling pilots; protocol teams diverge on ethical framing and consent | Lena publishes early lab notes on embodied cognition limits; Marcus pushes computational throughput over safety constraints; Sable prototypes predictive restoration models | `Ch.02` Scene 3 — Peripheral jump sequence through mixed lab footage; first scene anchor introducing Sable’s algorithmic fingerprints |
| 2028 | First successful short-lived neural signature reconstruction from controlled subject data | Lena grows increasingly concerned that “replay quality” creates a continuity illusion; Marcus defends the same event as a proof point for funding | `Ch.03` — Orin commission context scene references prior grants and pilot claims to motivate Lena-focused searches |
| 2029 | Internal ethics charter drafted for restricted experimental use | Lena and Marcus disagree on release timing; Sable quietly records system drift risks in private notes | `Ch.04` — Scene anchor showing Lena journaling late-night concerns and Sable’s first hidden branch of code |
| 2030 | Pre-Engram stability threshold crossed in simulations; controlled human subject tests begin in tightly supervised conditions | Lena begins direct involvement with live protocol execution; Marcus expands automated model stack | `Ch.04` Beat A — Juno’s first major Lena jump (Act 1) should include a 2030 lab test sequence as emotional anchor |
| 2031–2032 | “Engram-Lite” architecture established: incomplete but reliable short-span captures become possible | Lena sees her first ethically compromised test consent chain; Marcus downplays risk in exchange for momentum; Sable designs adaptive error correction for repeated reconstruction sessions | `Ch.05` — Early descent beat where Juno tracks the first complete but short-lifetime maps |
| 2033 | Project split pressure: public reporting demands clinical utility language, while internal team documents drift-like anomalies in long sessions | Sable’s cautionary notes rise; Lena starts pressing for explicit refusal rights in side channels | `Ch.05` Beat 2 and `Ch.06` — alternating scenes between lab optimism and hidden internal warnings |
| 2034–2035 | First long-form continuity trial approaches operational definition of “subject-level memory retention” | Lena and Sable quietly build a shared vocabulary around “integrity windows”; Marcus locks the runtime stack into scalable architecture | `Ch.06` — repeated scene anchor: Lena vs. Marcus argument over timeline compression and system trust |
| 2036 | First ethically disputed “continuation event” succeeds long enough to be considered a mapped persona event, but with memory discontinuities | Lena experiences first clear signs of moral fracture; Sable proposes guardrails that will later become architectural constraints | `Ch.07` — side-by-side Sable/Marcus architecture scene; Lena’s private doubt surfaces in jump sequence |
| 2037 | External capital surge enables full-scale prototype, and access becomes stratified by contract and jurisdiction | Marcus secures expansion; Lena becomes increasingly selective about recording participation; Sable hardens hidden governance hooks | `Ch.07` — archival scene showing contract annexes and coded suppression pathways (introduced as rumor only) |
| 2038–2039 | First "active continuity loop" prototype appears; system requires automated maintenance to prevent identity instability | Sable develops persistent reinforcement loops; Lena questions whether this is preservation or confinement; Marcus frames it as safety necessity | `Ch.08` — Maren warning-proxy scene should include archive hints of maintenance loops and unstable continuity |
| 2040–2041 | Rosetta protocol design begins: unified mapping, repair, and replay standards converge | Lena and Marcus integrate the standards into core pipeline; Sable stores hard boundaries in the Key design notes | `Ch.08` / `Ch.09` — first restricted archive references to “Rosetta” metadata; Juno chases missing nodes in this period |
| 2042–2043 | Institutional split formalized: public-facing optimism versus internal risk logs | Lena and Dara strengthen the documentary contradiction thread; Marcus protects team continuity by narrowing access; Sable’s private journals escalate into dual-purpose safeguards | `Ch.09` — confrontation-and-missing-recordings section should include one scene built from Dara-observed footage + Sable’s off-book logs |
| 2044–2045 | First commercial governance contract for memory retention services; Archive-classification requirements begin | Marcus champions rollout scaffolding; Sable’s constraint architecture is treated as “operational policy” not yet disclosed; Lena’s trust erodes | `Ch.09` / `Ch.10` — scene anchor for restricted logs, policy edits, and the first explicit deletion pattern |
| 2046–2049 | The Lattice-adjacent infrastructure is tested under load; unauthorized access attempts increase | Lena and Sable identify failure modes where unconstrained cognition destabilizes; Marcus argues speed over idealism | `Ch.10` — Sable private-recordings acquisition beat should show prototype behavior under edge cases and early constraint logic |
| 2050 | The first broad migration wave of near-complete human maps is approved under emergency pathways | Lena’s final internal objections are narrowed to technical objections by management; Sable builds correction policies for irreversible degradation | `Ch.10` — end-of-act-2 anchor: Rosetta system reveals “living process” qualities through late-stage maintenance logs |
| 2051–2054 | Early post-body continuity cohorts stabilize and spread beyond pilot environments | Public narrative calls it preservation; hidden logs warn of engineered limits | `Ch.11` and `Ch.12` future anchors as optional world-history context in rogue-jump sequences |
| 2055–2060 | Engram transitions become normalised in governance contexts and policy enforcement layers | Lena and Marcus’ operational split becomes entrenched; Sable shifts from prototype research to enforcement infrastructure | `Ch.12` — direct Sable perspective jump should draw from her work on self-modifying maintenance logic in this period |
| 2061–2067 | Curatorial controls and archive stratification harden as transition knowledge becomes high-risk doctrine | Orin-era governance lineages inherit constraints; retrospective editing of records deepens | `Ch.13` / `Ch.14` — future scene anchors can insert this as historical justification for present-era suppression and restriction |
| 2068–2070 | Secondary-generation maintenance teams run the first sustained constraint tuning cycles | Lena warns peers about “consensus stability” becoming indistinguishable from permission architecture; Marcus argues systems cannot run safely without it | `Ch.13` anchor candidate: historical scene of a closed-door governance hearing transcript |
| 2071 | Sable’s death; her private design journals become the most complete internal account of why constraints were retained | Sable exits formal publication channels; her hidden repository likely splits between official archives and hidden mirror sets | `Ch.14` Anchor A — Juno discovers the strongest single Sable-authored entry and sees direct evidence of design intention |
| 2072–2077 | Legacy stabilization period: practical continuity outpaces doctrine | Lena and Marcus operate under inherited assumptions; Dara-level records fade from active circulation | `Ch.14` / `Ch.15` — archival scenes showing suppression patterns, delayed corrections, and missing chain-of-custody evidence |
| 2078 | Lena dies; her later entries become retrospective anchors in multiple recording families | Lena’s final notes frame Rosetta as both rescue mechanism and boundary condition; Marcus references implementation legacy | `Ch.14` Anchor B — a late archival scene should include Lena’s final warning and practical instructions |
| 2079–2084 | Post-Lena transition administration formalizes archival partitions and access taxonomy | Curators begin codifying “safe” versus “restricted” access as doctrine for stability | `Ch.15` — present-future parallels can include this as historical evidence backing Orin’s stewardship posture |
| 2085–2089 | Infrastructure hardening and continuity optimization; drift-reduction protocols become mandatory | The system continues as operational orthodoxy with hidden unresolved design intent inherited from Sable’s work | `Ch.15` / `Ch.16` anchors for political framing: who benefits from “containment for safety” |
| 2090 | Transition Era officially closed in internal records; public-facing timeline declares preservation era complete while legacy constraints remain hidden in inherited layers | The present-day Juno era inherits a mature but bounded architecture; unresolved questions become narrative engine for disclosure | `Ch.16` / `Ch.17` — end-arc anchor for present-time implications and why the present investigation is both legal and emotional necessity |

## How to use this timeline

1. Use the timeline row as the first-pass continuity spine for any historical-jump cluster.
2. Before scene insertion, map the beat to a chapter beat slot and refine with a concrete in-scene objective.
3. Preserve reveal discipline:
   - early recording scenes prioritize emotional texture and sensory grounding,
   - mid-arc scenes emphasize system mechanics and contradictory testimony,
   - late scenes align directly to Curator control structures and living infrastructure evidence.
