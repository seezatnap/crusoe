# Summer 1994 15-Chapter Story Spine

Task: (#6) Lock the 15-chapter story spine from the 4-act PRD structure with chapter-level objectives, cliffhangers, reversals, POV assignments (Harry primary, plus one Ginny, one Ron, one Arthur chapter minimum), and end-of-act resolution conditions.

Lock version: `1.0`.

## Structural constraints

- 4-act structure retained exactly as defined in `specs.md`:
  - Act I: Chapters 1–4
  - Act II: Chapters 5–8
  - Act III: Chapters 9–12
  - Act IV: Chapters 13–15
- Primary POV default: **Harry**, with at least one chapter each for **Ginny**, **Ron**, and **Arthur**.
- Chapter 5 is the Ginny minimum, chapter 9 is the Ron minimum, chapter 11 is the Arthur minimum.

## Chapter-level spine (locked)

| Chapter | Act | POV | Objective | Reversal/Complication | Cliffhanger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | I | Harry | Bring Harry out of the Dursley holding and begin his first real family welcome in a foreign city; establish the emotional baseline of belonging. | Harry expects formality and distance, but chaos from the full Weasley household makes the welcome intimate and overwhelming. | Late in the night, Harry senses a faint, wrong resonance in a closet near the stairwell as the family sleeps. |
| 2 | I | Harry | Land the Weasleys in their SF domestic routine: Arthur’s Muggle amazement, Molly’s stress-baking, Fred and George’s first pranks. | The first burst of family comedy reveals an unexpected magical irregularity tied to Arthur’s improvised enchantments. | A routine object in town responds to magic in a way that should be impossible. |
| 3 | I | Harry | Expand the family-on-vacation texture through cable cars, fog, and city landmarks while letting Ron confront and soften his money-status anxiety. | Ron’s insecurity seems temporary until he realizes public perception in SF does not track Weasley class in the way he expects. | Fog over the bridge briefly forms a repeating symbol at the edge of Ron’s sight. |
| 4 | Harry | Open Fog Hollow through the Chinatown passage and establish Marisol, Gus, and the hidden quarter as a legitimate, dangerous-yet-vibrant magical ecosystem. | What should be a safe curiosity visit carries signs that local ward systems are already being tested. | The alley locks for a breath; exit is granted only after a stranger slips the trio through a counter-ward sequence. |
| 5 | Ginny | Contrast British and American magical culture at Coit Academy; seed the investigative spine through Ginny’s recurring symbol sketch. | Ginny’s harmless curiosity becomes frightening when she sketches the same sigil in two unrelated places. | A local symbol appears to be linked to the old magical ward language Marisol vaguely recognizes. |
| 6 | Harry | Use the Alcatraz tour as the first explicit detection point for concentrated dark residue. | The ruined wing is framed as historical, but Bill and Harry confirm the wards are being actively pressured from outside. | A compass-like response to tide and spell residue points toward the Underlook approaches. |
| 7 | Harry | Let Fred, George, and Marisol pursue pranks that accidentally become reconnaissance; discover operational movement near the waterfront. | Their joke mission shifts into an intelligence wind-up when surveillance signs reveal they have already been observed. | A black-and-white pelican with a trained flight pattern circles overhead with unnatural precision. |
8 | Harry | Deepen Arthur–Gus alliance, deliver Tomo into the loop, and convert concern into coordinated investigation. | Tomo initially blocks access, then concedes that this is an active security threat at city scale. | The strongest ward map they can build points inland to unstable cave channels tied to old Alcatraz corridors. |
9 | Ron | Confirm the sigil’s meaning and map disturbances to one converging underground locus tied to the caves. | Ron’s analytical model turns the family’s scattered clues into a hard target map the enemy can use against them. | A marker with children’s names appears on the fog wall near the convergence point. |
10 | Harry | Send Bill and Tomo into the Underlook perimeter for material proof: ingredients, routes, and timing mechanisms. | Their recon proves successful too early and triggers counter-surveillance; Harlan’s network is now actively hunting them. | A maintenance channel closes behind them and leaves fresh compulsion residue in the tunnel lip. |
11 | Arthur | Test Voss’s compulsion plan in controlled streetscape conditions and force the adult ethics decision: stay and confront or retreat and preserve the children. | Arthur’s command strategy fails once compulsion reaches people personally connected to the family. | The children, outraged and restless, decide to continue investigating despite the adults’ warning. |
12 | Harry | Run the children’s unsanctioned Underlook entry, trap-breakdown sequence, and escape from Harlan’s first direct engagement. | The mission fails as an entry task and becomes survival; escape depends on Ron’s planning and Fred/George improvisation. | Isolde refuses to finish a lethal spell, creating a narrow opening—and a dangerous new motive for her. |
13 | Harry | Converge the entire team at the coast and synchronize final assault timing before the ritual reaches irreversible stage one. | The team discovers Voss has already primed the first ritual anchor; there is almost no margin left. | The fog itself begins the ceremonial shift as the team enters the caves. |
14 | Harry | Execute the cave battle: disrupt anchors, hold children safe, and force Isolde’s split from Voss while Tomo and Bill move the final ward controls. | The ritual destabilizes faster than expected, and a direct Harlan intervention forces a split between Arthur and the children’s rescue track. | Voss attempts compulsion directly on Harry at the instant anchor resistance finally weakens. |
15 | Harry | Resolve the compulsion test, end the ritual, escape the flood surge, and deliver emotional closure for the family before departure. | Victory is won at personal cost and under pressure: only perfect timing across wards and household defense avoids a panic spillover. | No cliffhanger. Story resolves into a grounded homeward-beacon moment on the Golden Gate. |

## End-of-act resolution conditions

- Act I (after chapter 4):  
  - Family is physically settled in the Haight House and Harry’s belonging arc is activated.  
  - Fog Hollow is introduced as a believable magical district with one clear irregularity signal.  
  - Local allies are named (Marisol, Gus) and remain outside direct threat.  
- Act II (after chapter 8):  
  - Evidence links Haight/Fog Hollow incidents with the Alcatraz magical wing through Ward-sign/compulsion residue logic.  
  - Bill, Tomo, and Arthur are operationally aligned and can no longer treat the anomalies as isolated anomalies.  
  - The antagonists’ scale is now understood as a deliberate ritual campaign.  
- Act III (after chapter 12):  
  - Compulsion fog threat is confirmed as public danger.  
  - Undertow retaliation is confirmed; the children’s safety is now tied to mission success.  
  - Isolde’s internal fracture is in place and becomes an exploitable leverage point for the endgame.  
- Act IV (after chapter 15):  
  - Voss’s ritual is terminated and threat to Fog Hollow collapses before mass compromise.  
  - Harlan and Voss are in BMA custody; Isolde enters cooperation channels for evidence and sentencing context.  
  - Weasleys leave San Francisco with family cohesion intact and Harry’s new sense of home preserved.
