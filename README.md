This repository uses a Rust-based quality pipeline and style-reference helper tooling.

## Contributor workflow

Before drafting, run `scripts/pre-draft-session.sh` (recommended) to pull fresh
`style-reference` samples and run the full quality pipeline on your target chapter.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for full command usage and options.
